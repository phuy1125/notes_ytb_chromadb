      "We have to add honey as well.\n",
      "Mh.\n",
      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "We'll add sugar and honey\n",
      "to the butter.\n",
      "About 2 tablespoons of sugar.\n",
      "Maybe a little bit more\n",
      "we'll see how it looks.\n",
      "Maybe some more of the butter?\n",
      "Put it in?\n",
      "Mh.\n",
      "Wait until it boils.\n",
      "It's fine. Everything's fine.\n",
      "Our mixture is boiling.\n",
      "We will boil it for 3-4 minutes \n",
      "until it becomes brown.\n",
      "Light brown.\n",
      "Then we will mix everything\n",
      "with popcorns.\n",
      "Our mixture is getting really \n",
      "brown\n",
      "but we will wait some more.\n",
      "Maybe you should mix it.\n",
      "No. Like that.\n",
      "We'll keep it a bit longer.\n",
      "An we will pour it over\n",
      "the popcorns.\n",
      "The popcorns are coming.\n",
      "So, our sauce is really brown.\n",
      "Turn off the heating.\n",
      "We will pour it over the \n",
      "popcorns.\n",
      "Be very carefull while pouring\n",
      "the sauce, it's very hot.\n",
      "You can pour some then add some more.\n",
      "What do you think?\n",
      "Let's wait and we will \n",
      "\"shoot\".\n",
      "You won't be able to clean it \n",
      "later.\n",
      "Let's try with salt first.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "It's over there, isn't it?\n",
      "Yes, there.\n",
      "It's okay with beer.\n",
      "Now with cheese powder or \n",
      "dip powder to be precice.\n",
      "It's not good for me. \n",
      "To be honest I wouldn't \n",
      "recommend to try it with \n",
      "dip powder\n",
      "because it's not cheese powder \n",
      "and\n",
      "I was expecting different \n",
      "result.\n",
      "It doesn't change the flavour and\n",
      "it's not worth trying them.\n",
      "I'm expecting the most \n",
      "from these.\n",
      "As probably most of you.\n",
      "So, let's try it, MO\n",
      "The tastiest?\n",
      "Probably.\n",
      "Granny will like it as well\n",
      "as grandpa and grandchildren.\n",
      "It's definitely the tastiest\n",
      "from three of these recipes.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So, thank you for watching \n",
      "and wait for new episodes.\n",
      "Say \"goodbye\", MO.\n",
      "Goodbye! Best of luck!\n",
      "Cheers!\n",
      "So, we tried to mix dip powder with oil\n",
      "and heat it.\n",
      "We poured it over.\n",
      "Compared to the previous \n",
      "try the rsults are rather great.\n",
      "Much better when without oil.\n",
      "If you want to try it, try it \n",
      "like that.\n",
      "With oil, heat it, then pour\n",
      "it over.\n",

      "flour, which you'll need \n",
      "around 190 ml.\n",

      "Add some oil.\n",
      "It's not KFC, so it won't\n",
      "be that long.\n",
      "It will be fast. That's enough.\n",
      "It will be quick.\n",
      "That's enough. It's a nonsense.\n",
      "Tell us what you are doing.\n",

      "We will use sugar to prepare\n",

      "We will put 200 g of sugar\n",

      "not all of it is able to melt,\n",

      "That's it.\n",
      "Why, MO?\n",

      "Virtual reality what you are seeing right now and what\n",
      "you see in real life? The mountains, trees. Is the image\n",
      "different to you in any way?\n",
      "Romas, it's like this in other countries, isn't it?\n",
      "Yes, but do you see any difference? Maybe it looks\n",
      "worse or is it the same?\n",
      "It looks the same.\n",

      "covering the chop. Both sides\n",
      "of course.\n",
      "This is how covered chops\n",
      "look like. I can't wait to try \n",

      "bit... About. Half an hour, hour\n",

      "Yes.\n",
      "If they don't have any brains,\n",
      "then the beauty is useless.\n",
      "Maybe it'll be the same with\n",
      "chops.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I think they will be not only\n",
      "beautiful, but also tasty.\n",
      "It's cooking. What do think, MO?\n",

      "that much space\n",
      "and now we'll add it to fry it.\n",
      "Not like to fry it, but more\n",
      "like to cover it with the sauce.\n",
      "And of course mix everything\n",
      "well with the sauce.\n",

      "Add some butter.\n",
      "What we going to do now?\n",
      "We are going to melt the butter and then we will fry the cutlets…\n",
      "I mean chops.\n",
      "Take a chop, put it in the flour, then into the preheated skillet for about 6-7 \n",
      "minutes per side or until the chop is nicely browned.\n",
      "We’ll clean the frying pan and then we will make the sauce.\n",

      "I had some expectations for this dish and I was totally, completely, 100 percent…\n",
      "Not disappointed!\n",
      "I guess the key thing in making this dish is to get the right balance of \n",
      "lemon.\n",
      "The lemon zest gives it a unique taste, but you know, don’t go \n",
      "crazy with it and should be good!\n",

      "We’ll see if it doesn’t stick, MO. We’ll see.\n",
      "Whatever happens, happens...\n",
      "We suggest you leave bigger gaps between the cookies and you will soon find out soon why.\n",
      "The oven is preheated to 180 °C. The cooking time should be somewhere between 12 to 25 minutes.\n",

      "Our cookies are stuck together, but it doesn’t matter. Heh… \n",
      "Yeah… The baking tray is too small, little Romas. This baking tray, you know… We need a larger baking tray… \n",

      "[It’s] very tasty!\n",
      "Mh. Okay… \n",
      "They look incredible, but the craziest thing about them is that they taste much better they cool off completely\n",

      "You’ll have to make it that larger, MO.\n",
      "Will I have to blow it out? \n",
      "Mh. \n",
      "You see, maybe it will be large enough. \n",
      "We’ll put it a warm place to proof. \n",
      "About 1 hour, 2.\n",
      "Probably 1 hour, we’ll see maybe more than 1 hour for it to proof. \n",
      "OK.\n",
      "Let’s bring it to the bathroom.\n",
      "You are stupid. \n",
      "Heh… MO said to stop it…\n",
      "So what? We have to show how we do it. \n",

      "You see, I forgot to blend everything together, so I am doing it now.\n",
      "To all ingredients I have added some tomato puree and now I am blending them. \n",
      "So, don’t forget to blend everything before putting the mixture over the heat. \n",
      "Of course, we could have blended everything before, but I forgot, so it will be just fine like this. \n",
      "Everything is fine here.\n",
      "So, at the moment we’re reducing the sauce.    \n",
      "It will take some time....\n",
      "Maybe half an hour, not so sure… \n",

      "So, keep watching us and you’ll see how we manage to do that.\n",
      "Cut the cheese in cubes or any other shape you want.\n",
      "We are using something like Parmesan, \n",
      "some orange cheddar and some nameless \n",
      "regular cheese.\n",
      "You know what?\n",
      "We should push the dough to the sides, if that’s possible.\n",
      "You can…\n",
      "His dough wasn’t too even too. \n",
      "Whatever you can. \n",

      "Would you look at this!\n",
      "It’s so beautiful in the forest…\n",
      "Close the oven.\n",
      "Don’t you think to cut it…\n",
      "Is it stuck?\n",
      "Mh.\n",
      "It’s not too bad.\n",
      "You see, little Romas, it’s very hot.\n",
      "Actually you can wait.\n",
      "But we have to hurry.\n",
      "I’m not sure if that was the ingredients we used or the oven program, but \n",
      "the base was different, but in a good.\n",
      "Like a flat bun, but with cheese sauce and everything!\n",
      "I don’t think I can recommend it enough to you.\n",

      "MO is planting the potatoes, aren't you?\n",
      "MO is planting them, but Romas and Matas, and everyone will eat them.\n",
      "But we're planting them, MO. But you know, MO, it's a job\n",
      "for robots...\n",
      "Okay, okay, you are robot...\n",
      "I'm for real.\n",
      "We're like robots as well.\n",
      "I'm not a robot, MO.\n",
      "It's a nice feeling to touch the soil...\n",
      "Maube for 5 minutes, but not for long, for a few hours.\n",
      "What do you mean \" for long\". It has only been 1 hour.\n",
      "The sun is coming down now.\n",

      "Thank you, little children, thank you, thank you for helping me!\n",
      "Why don't you show them what we have done. Tell us.\n",
      "Look at it. We have planted the potatoes. Let's go home,\n",
      "the sun is going down.\n",
      "How many kilos have we planted?\n",
      "Buckets. How many? Bags?\n",
      "9 buckets.\n",
      "Ah, maybe even more.\n",
      "Maybe.\n",
      "How many rows have we planted?\n",
      "9 rows, little Romas. Here we have 3 empty rows, which we\n",

      "It is, yeah...\n",
      "Show your potatoes.\n",
      "They are huge!\n",

      "Aha.\n",
      "But you see, Romas, just a few.\n",
      "Not many?\n",
      "Not many, 4 potatoes, some times 6 - there are some smaller\n",
      "ones, usually there aren't many...\n",
      "Not many at all.\n",
      "You shouldn't have been complaining that much then as there are some.\n",

      "Yes!\n",
      "Why aren't you asking for your subscribers to help?\n",

      "Okay take it, I'll let you film!\n",
      "I see you walking!\n",
      "So, I'm helping, MO!\n",
      "Because nobody else is helping!\n",
      "Good boy!\n",
      "What kind of chemicals have you put in, so that they so large?\n",
      "Some grass...\n",
      "Rotten.\n",
      "Yes, Romas, did you see how much grass there was...\n",
      "Not really.\n",
      "You don't remember.\n",
      "Everything was spread accros the soil in the autumn.\n",
      "Look at these, MO. You were complaining that there would be\n",
      "no potatoes.\n",

      "Yes, yes.\n",
      "The potatoes are really beautiful, little children.\n",
      "I'll peel the potatoes now.\n",
      "Do you know how to peel the potatoes? Eh? Have you helped me at least once?\n",
      "I have helped you.\n",
      "I'll see how you would help me.\n",
      "You'll have to help me if you want to eat some zeppelins today.\n",
      "Who will be filming?\n",
      "Mh?\n",
      "You don't to film people peeling the potaoes. It will be faster, if you help me.\n",
      "We're putting them into some cold water.\n",
      "We will be grating the potaoes now.\n",
      "We will squeeze... The grated potatoes.\n",
      "Look at this specialy disigned bag.\n",
      "Yes, it's nice!\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "You can put more.\n",
      "Ahh, it's difficult, Romas.\n",
      "You don't have to squeeze all the way out, don't you?\n",
      "No, no.\n",
      "Here.\n",
      "We're moving it over there.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Here. We'll move the liquid to a different container, so that\n",
      "the starch would start to set.\n",
      "We' prepare the stuffing for the zeppelins.\n",
      "What are you doing here?\n",
      "Cut the onions finely.\n",
      "A couple of onions.\n",
      "Yes. One is larger, one is smaller. That will be enough\n",
      "We're adding them to the meat.\n",
      "We're adding some dried basil leaves.\n",
      "Mhm.\n",
      "What else?\n",
      "And peppers. Almost a full teaspoon.\n",
      "Maybe I should get a teaspoon for the salt.\n",
      "And salt... That will be too much...\n",
      "Not much of it.\n",
      "Here.\n",
      "That's it.\n",
      "Mangle everything well.\n",
      "The water is set to start boiling for the zeppelins.\n",
      "Here. We will make the potato batter now.\n",
      "Drain the liquid...\n",
      "Out...\n",
      "Here.\n",
      "We will put the starch into the grated potaoes.\n",
      "Quality stuff.\n",
      "You see quality everywhere.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Mix everything now, right?\n",
      "Yeah, we will mix everything and...\n",
      "Here.\n",
      "As always you will be able to find the recipe in the link in the \n",
      "description below.\n",
      "Yes, we're adding the starch.\n",
      "You'll put everything in, won't you?\n",
      "Yes, I will probably put everything in, Romas.\n",
      "I can't rub it off.\n",
      "Some salt.\n",
      "One and a half?\n",
      "That will be enough for sure. We will be adding some salt to\n",
      "the water as well.\n",
      "It won't be too salty.\n",
      "Let's mangle it.\n",
      "So, MO?\n",
      "Take a piece of grated potato mixture.\n",
      "Make sort of... a pancake\n",
      "We'll add some meat. Heh.\n",
      "Fold the edges.\n",
      "Close it and there will be a zeppelin.\n",
      "So, you decided to make a few with the curd.\n",
      "Yeah, I'll make a few for with the curd, but you don't like them,\n",
      "but I like them a lot.\n",
      "Here.\n",
      "The making of them is the same, isn't it?\n",
      "Yeah, it's the same. I won't be adding anything, no salt, no egg,\n",
      "to this curd.\n",
      "But you can.\n",
      "Yes, you can, but I don't need it here.\n",
      "You can add some fried bacon pieces.\n",
      "\"Fried bacon pieces.\"\n",
      "You can add some smoked bacon to the curd.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "But I don't need any bacon, no nothing.\n",
      "We'll make rounded balls.\n",
      "Here.\n",
      "Those will be my zeppelins.\n",
      "You'll eat 3 of them, won't you?\n",
      "2!\n",
      "3.\n",
      "I'll leave the third one for you.\n",
      "I think you will eat all 3 of them.\n",
      "Maybe I will eat all 3.\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "I won't eat any with the meat and...\n",
      "I am goin to the shop to more curd, so you could make of\n",
      "them.\n",
      "Stop dreaming, okay?\n",
      "I'l have enough, Romas.\n",
      "Here.\n",
      "We'll add large teaspoon of salt... Maybe...\n",
      "I'll add a little bit more...\n",
      "Here.\n",
      "\"What are you doing?\" I'm adding them to the pot to boil.\n",
      "We'll add them.\n",
      "How long will they boil?\n",
      "At least 15 minutes.\n",
      "Will 9 be enough for you?\n",
      "Maybe that will be enough for today.\n",
      "Here.\n",
      "Boil nicely and don't break.\n",
      "The sauce is being prepared for the zeppelins.\n",
      "So, what' now?\n",
      "We'll wait for them to fry.\n",
      "We'll cut the... The bacon is cut.\n",
      "We will cut the onions later and put them in. You can stop\n",
      "filiming, little Romas.\n",
      "But you can film, if you want.\n",
      "How long will you fry them for?\n",
      "For about 3 minutes, everything will be done, the sauce will\n",
      "be done.\n",
      "The zeppelins are really nice.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You have decreased the temperature, haven't you?\n",
      "No, I haven't.\n",
      "It's boiling slowly, maybe it will be okay.\n",
      "Oh, they are soft.\n",
      "Your zeppelins are soft.\n",
      "That's it.\n",
      "How many do you want right now? 5 of them?\n",
      "2.\n",
      "I though I should put 5 in for you.\n",
      "So, I'm going to try them now of course.\n",
      "It will the happy part now, won't it?\n",
      "You can call it like that.\n",
      "It's so hot for me!\n",
      "This is how it looks.\n",
      "If you have not tried Lithuanian zeppelins, be sure to try them.\n",
      "The zeppelins can be eaten without any fried bacon pieces,\n",
      "but most Lithuanians like them fat,\n",
      "but maybe you're not Lithuanian.\n",
      "Well, the most important thing is to eat in a way, so you would enjoy them!\n",
      "This recipe is really simple.\n",
      "There aren't any fancy ingredients, but the zeppelins are\n",
      "pretty much incredible!\n",

      "Let it boil for about 10 minutes and then…\n",
      "What’s now? \n",
      "We’ll take the meat out and get rid of the broth. \n",
      "What are you doing now? \n",
      "Nothing. I’m cleaning it and that’s it. \n",
      "And then again into the pot. \n",
      "Increase the heat, so it would start boiling. \n",
      "We’ll boil it for at least 3 hours once it starts boiling. Yes...\n",
      "Tell me, what you put in here. \n",
      "What?! Carrots, onions, pepper, bay leaves, salt. \n",
      "All spices. \n",
      "You see how slowly it’s boiling. You have to boil it slowly, little Romas.\n",
      "Maybe I’ll cover it a bit, so it would boil faster, but it will be boiling for a \n",
      "long time. \n",
      "Mh.\n",
      "The meat is fall off the bones. \n",
      "You know, Romas, it is done. We have to turn it off now.\n",
      "We’ll eat, then we’ll take the meat off the bones. \n",
      "Okay. \n",
      "Turn it off. \n",
      "I’m covering it and leaving it... \n",
      "Let’s finish the Meat Jelly. That’s enough of you to... \n",
      "Look at this clear water which it has been boiling in. \n",
      "Mh. \n",
      "Put this lid over there. That’s enough. \n",
      "What do we have to do now, MO? \n",
      "Take it out of the water take the meat off the bones and cut the meat in \n",
      "small pieces. \n",
      "“What do we have to do?“\n",
      "You’ll see what we have to do. \n",
      "I’m deboning the meat. I’m taking the bones out of the meat. \n",
      "Here, it will be the best... \n",
      "Here, Romas, a full bowl of meat. \n",
      "Mh. But there are a lot of bones as well. \n",
      "No... Look at it. There should be more meat than bones. \n",
      "Yes, there more meat, but still. \n",
      "Let’s put it over the heat, Romce. \n",
      "Okay. \n",
      "Turn it on. \n",
      "Here. It will boil. Jesus, the pot is so heavy. \n",
      "I have to add some water right now, because that will be too little of it...\n",
      "It won’t look as meat jelly at all.\n",
      "We’ll add a teaspoon of it and then we’ll add more, if needed. \n",
      "All of you have taste buds in your mouth... \n",
      "One likes it without the salt at all. \n",
      "While the other likes drinking salt water. \n",
      "Yes. \n",
      "Here. It has started boiling and has been boiling for some time. \n",
      "Pepper.\n",
      "6 garlic cloves. \n",
      "And, and, and…\n",
      "Here we have dried celery leaves and lovage leaves. \n",
      "That’s it... \n",
      "We’ll mix it and see if we need more salt. It will be good. \n",
      "We’ll pour it to the containers. \n",
      "…taste buds... He-he... \n",
      "You have to feel the salt. If you don’t, then it won’t be salty. \n",
      "Mh. Maybe I should add some more, because it will taste different \n",
      "when it cools off.\n",
      "I’ll add some more. \n",
      "It’ll be okay for sure now.\n",
      "You have to feel the salt. \n",
      "It’s different when it cools off. \n",
      "The work is done. \n",
      "Yes... \n",
      "We have to pour it into the containers you have and cool it off a cool place. \n",
      "Let’s pour it into some container. \n",
      "It has to have some liquid as well as meaty parts. \n",
      "Yes, yes... \n",
      "Okay, that’s it. \n",
      "Here. \n",
      "We’ll pour it into the containers like this and it will be prepared this \n",
      "Meat Jell. Here you are. \n",
      "We’ll wait for it to cool off. \n",
      "We’ll put it a cool place and it will cool off. Here. \n",
      "This is how you have to do it, MO, right? \n",
      "Yes. \n",
      "Whoosh. \n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "Here!\n",
      "Look at it! \n",
      "I have put it not straight, Romas. \n",
      "It doesn’t matter. It’s crazy! \n",
      "He-he-he-he... \n",
      "You have done it nicely! \n",
      "Yes! \n",
      "I was trying really hard. \n",
      "Here, Romas. This way!\n",
      "Ta-dum! \n",
      "What will you be eating it with?\n",
      "With some horseradish. Don’t you want some? \n",
      "It’s already in! \n",
      "I like it with some horseradish. \n",
      "Eat it, eat it! \n",
      "“Eat it”. Do you let me? \n",
      "Mh. \n",
      "Are the horseradish too potent? \n",
      "Yeah? \n",
      "Very potent, little Romas!\n",
      "How’s the Meat Jelly? \n",
      "It’s tasty! Please, try it! \n",
      "Okay! \n",
      "Meat jelly was great and tasty. By the way, you can add more water if \n",
      "you want more jelly, but I like it as it is. \n",
      "One more thing. If you are wondering how MO managed to place the \n",
      "decorations so nicely. \n",
      "She had put a thin layer of jelly liquid, put the decorations in, cooled off \n",
      "the layer of jelly and then she poured little bit cooled off Meat Jelly.\n",
      "That’s the secret. \n",
      "Is it all of it for me to eat it?\n",
      "You’ll eat it. \n",
      "In a few days we will, yes.\n",
      "During today! \n",
      "Thank you for making it! \n",
      "It was tasty! \n",
      "Good, eat it then. \n",
      "You can look here, into the camera. You can say something to the \n",
      "viewers. \n",
      "Try to make some Meat Jelly yourself. \n",
      "Okay, I’ll say it like this. \n",
      "We have listened to your recommendations and made the Meat Jelly.\n",
      "You can write more recommendations, maybe we’ll do them someday!\n",
      "Thank you for watching and until next time! Bye! \n",

      "Good afternoon! Today we are making Minced Pike.\n",
      "Where did you get this pike from? \n",
      "Did you catch it yourself? \n",
      "Of course, I did. \n",
      "She went to the lake, caught a fish and came back. \n",
      "Heh... Yeah, and brought it back home. \n",
      "What did we put in? \n",
      "Onions to fry. \n",
      "Okay, you’ll have to look after them.\n",
      "Look at this beautiful fish. \n",
      "Which I caught by myself. \n",
      "How’s it done? \n",
      "I’ll leave this tail fin...\n",

      "Do you see what’s left of the pike?\n",
      "Mh.\n",
      "Yes, Romas, we will put the meat in. We’ll mince it and put it in. \n",
      "Mmm… \n",
      "We’ll put the spices in and that’s it.  \n",
      "There will be a pike. What do you mean “you won’t use it”? \n",
      "I don’t know… \n",
      "Now it’s time to get all the meat. \n",
      "We’ll mince the meat twice now. \n",
      "Our onions are done now, so we'll leave them to cool off.\n",
      "Put it in the balcony to cool off, MO.\n",
      "Come on, Romas, Stop it, Romas!\n",
      "Stop it with your nonsense.\n",
      "It has to cool off and that's it. That's you should have said.\n",
      "We have to show as well.\n",

      "Don't curse, I'll have to bleep out again...\n",
      "Romas, I know you won't be doing such nonsenses...\n",
      "The onions are cooling off here in the balcony.\n",
      "This is my garden, I have a lot of spices.\n",
      "What do you have to say?\n",
      "What is growing here?\n",
      "Here we have some rosemary, basil, again rosemary, basil.\n",
      "What do we have here?\n",
      "Ahh... I think parsley.\n",
      "And. Ahhh...\n",
      "How is it?\n",
      "Thyme.\n",
      "We'll use a meat grinder to mince the onions.\n",
      "So, that little children wouldn't take them our and eat \n",
      "everything.\n",
      "They wouldn't feel them.\n",

      "A teaspoon.\n",
      "That will surely be enough, little Romas.\n",
      "2 tablespoons of semolina.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "A couple of eggs.\n",
      "I think that we'll be enough butter for it.\n",
      "So, it won't be low-fat.\n",
      "Grate one half of carrot or as much or little as you want.\n",
      "You are after all the master of your own kitchen.\n",

      "We'll mangle the fish now.\n",
      "Where did you learn this recipe from, MO?\n",
      "From my head, I made it.\n",
      "I'm asking for real.\n",
      "We used to do it before, Romas.\n",
      "There was minced carp in pieces just like this.\n",
      "We had to make it, Romas.\n",
      "We had huge... We had huge pots to prepare and took us\n",
      "forever.\n",
      "The most important moment is right now, MO.\n",
      "I have cut off too much, but there's nothing we can do.\n",
      "Explain, MO, what we have to do here, MO.\n",
      "Here. We will put the meat back into the skin.\n",
      "We'll stuff the meat back inside.\n",
      "It will be boneless fish, MO.\n",
      "It will be boneless, so you will not need to take the bones out\n",
      "today.\n",
      "Let's roll it.\n",
      "Here! We'll put it to the pot.\n",
      "Here.\n",
      "Oh...\n",
      "We'll fix it when it's hot after taking it out.\n",
      "Okay. Here.\n",
      "It's your fish, MO, you caught it.\n",
      "Okay, that's enough, let's go.\n",
      "What did you use to catch it?\n",
      "I used a fishing rod, what do you think?\n",
      "Yeah, but did you use a fish or those dead gummies?\n",
      "I don't know what I used and don't ask me more. Here. That's it.\n",
      "Mmm...\n",
      "We'll add a carrot.\n",
      "Here. Okay.\n",
      "Some bay leaves. What else?\n",
      "Here. Allpice.\n",
      "1, 2, ... 4, 5, 6. There will 6 of them.\n",
      "And some black ones. 1... Okay it doesn't matter.\n",
      "Here. Some black ones and some allspice.\n",
      "Parsley, salt.\n",
      "1 tablespoon, I mean 1 teaspoon.\n",
      "Okay, that's it. Now some cold water and that will be it.\n",
      "Here.\n",
      "It has enough water to its eyes.\n",
      "How long will we boil it for?\n",
      "After it starts boiling 35 minutes or 40 minutes.\n",
      "The last minutes for the fish to boil.\n",
      "Call it a squid.\n",
      "A squid. That will be your squid.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "5 more minutes and it will be done.\n",
      "It's good.\n",
      "It's done, little Romas.\n",
      "We'll take it to the balcony to cool off, won't we?\n",
      "Heh, to the freezer to cool off...\n",
      "You can't put it to the freezer, MO.\n",
      "He-he-he-he-he-he-he-he...\n",
      "So, what that you are filiming, little Romas. You won't be\n",
      "adding it.\n",
      "I will, the fish is swimming towards us. Here...\n",
      "Come on...\n",
      "You are putting everything on the ground...\n",
      "Oh...\n",
      "I see, little Romas, here.\n",
      "We'll soak 1 tablespoon of gelatine\n",
      "We'll pour it over to make our pike more beautiful.\n",
      "We're pouring 250 ml of water.\n",
      "And we'll soak it, that's it.\n",
      "What will it be now?\n",
      "Help us, God, to take it out easily. Heh- he- he.\n",
      "Ohhh...Ehhhh... Here...\n",
      "Look at it!\n",
      "Do you see how beautiful it looks, Romas?\n",
      "That's the soup!\n",
      "Yes, you can, boil something to eat.\n",
      "We are untying, are we?\n",
      "We'll untie it and undress it.\n",
      "Ahhh...\n",
      "How good this is.\n",
      "Curl to the side, tail.\n",
      "Wait, I have to...\n",
      "A monster pike.\n",
      "Yup, a real monster. Look at this monster.\n",
      "It's not bad at all.\n",
      "Yeah, it's not bad at all.\n",
      "Heh-he-he...\n",
      "We'll leave it to cool off and then we'll pour some liquid over.\n",
      "We'll dress it up.\n",
      "Again. He-he-he-he....\n",
      "The liquid is nice.\n",
      "Everything will be used to pour over the fish. That's it, Romas.\n",
      "We'll heat the gelatine, so it would soak.\n",
      "We'll put it here for it to heat it up and...\n",
      "Here. Do you see it?\n",
      "It melted.\n",
      "Yes, that's it.\n",
      "We'll add one of this as well.\n",
      "1 cup.\n",
      "That will be enough of this liquid.\n",
      "That will be enough over our eyes. That's it.\n",
      "So?\n",
      "It need just a little bit more salt.\n",
      "It has started setting, so we're pouring it over.\n",
      "There's nothing else to tell. Here.\n",
      "You see, it will be ice pike. Covered in ice.\n",
      "Mmm...\n",
      "It's a shame to cut, isn't it?\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "It would be better if we just put aside to look at.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Look, MO, you can't even say that it was cut.\n",
      "Here.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "Okay, okay, you can barely see it.\n",
      "You must be thinking, that it is bad as I having such a small\n",
      "bite, but really it really isn't.\n",
      "It's just that picked up the fork with right hand and I wasn't\n",
      "comfortable for me, so I wanted to be done with the tasting \n",
      "scene as soon as possible.\n",
      "It's honestly good and you should try it!\n",
      "The best thing about is that it doesn't have any bones.\n",
      "Anyway, now it's MO's turn to try.\n",
      "It's very tasty indeed!\n",
      "All it needs now is some white salad.\n",
      "Why don't you do it this white salad?\n",
      "We will make it, but there wasn't enough time.\n",

      "Here are the key notes extracted from the video transcript:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Goal:** Automate the process of extracting notes from YouTube videos and saving them to a vector database.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tools and Technologies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Python Packages:**\n",
      "    *   `youtube_transcript_api`: To extract transcripts from YouTube videos.\n",
      "    *   Google Gemini (Large Language Model): To convert transcripts into neat notes and for embedding.\n",
      "    *   Qdrant (Vector Database): To store and retrieve notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Gemini Setup:**\n",
      "    *   Obtain a Gemini API key (free tier available).\n",
      "    *   Instantiate the Gemini model using the key and model code (consider request limits).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Qdrant Setup:**\n",
      "    *   Create a Qdrant database using `kb.persistent_client` (specifying a path).\n",
      "    *   Create an embedding function using Gemini to convert text to embeddings.\n",
      "    *   Create a collection within the database (e.g., \"YouTube notes\"), linking it to the embedding function.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Workflow:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Extract Transcript:**\n",
      "    *   Get the YouTube video ID.\n",
      "    *   Use `youtube_transcript_api` to extract the transcript (specify language).\n",
      "    *   Format the transcript into plain text.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Generate Notes:**\n",
      "    *   Pass the transcript and a prompt (e.g., \"extract notes from transcript\") to the Gemini model.\n",
      "    *   Get the generated notes from the model's response.\n",
      "    *   *The transcript is likely to have formatting errors, so the output may not be perfect.*\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Save Notes to Qdrant:**\n",
      "    *   Use the `upsert` function of the Qdrant collection to save the notes.\n",
      "    *   Use the YouTube video ID as the unique identifier for the record.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Search Notes:**\n",
      "    *   Formulate a search query (e.g., \"how much beef do I need?\").\n",
      "    *   Use `kb.query` to search the Qdrant database, specifying the query text and what data to include in the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Answer Questions:**\n",
      "    *   Pass the search results (specifically the relevant notes) to the Gemini model.\n",
      "    *   Construct a prompt asking Gemini to answer a specific question based on the provided context (notes).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Points:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The speaker uses Visual Studio Code and a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
      "*   The free tier of Gemini has request limits (check current limitations).\n",
      "*   Transcripts may contain errors, so notes may require manual editing.\n",
      "*   Qdrant's `upsert` function allows inserting or updating records.\n",
      "*   The speaker suggests a user interface would be a beneficial improvement.\n",
      "*   The sqLite viewer extension can be used to view the contents of the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, the video outlines a Python script that automates the process of extracting YouTube video transcripts, summarizing them using a large language model, and storing them in a vector database for later searching and question answering.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Themes:** The video appears to revolve around themes of heartbreak, betrayal, and female empowerment. There's a sense of a relationship gone sour, marked by infidelity and deceit.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Key Phrases & Imagery:**\n",
      "    *   \"Rót nước mắt vững trên khuôn nhạc\" (Pouring tears firm on the musical score): Suggests using pain and sorrow as inspiration for art (music).\n",
      "    *   \"Vàng oanh tạc nàng đành lòng lấy bức tranh sơn vàng\" (Gold raids, she resigned herself to taking the golden painting): This implies settling for something less valuable or authentic after being hurt by a pursuit of wealth (\"gold\").\n",
      "    *   \"Yêu xa hoa trăng hoa tính đạc hoa yêu\" (Love extravagance, promiscuity, calculating the flower of love): Describes a love filled with superficiality and infidelity.\n",
      "    *   References to \"trướng\" (obstruction), \"nướng khoai\" (roasting sweet potatoes) as being boring or commonplace (\"nhạt dis\").\n",
      "    *    Mention of being a \"nhân viên\" (employee), \"đối tác\" (partner), and being underestimated (\"chỉ vì anh không biết em là ai cả\" - only because you don't know who I am).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Story Elements:**\n",
      "    *   Infidelity is a major plot point (\"Người ta yêu xa hoa trăng hoa\"). The female character has left a \"nhanh hoa\" (flower) behind, attracting flies.\n",
      "    *   There's a confrontation.\n",
      "    *   The betrayed woman is assertive and warns the man to behave properly (\"Yêu đương như thế thì có ngày tao tát\").\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Emotional Tone:**\n",
      "    *   Resentment and anger are evident in the lyrics.\n",
      "    *   The speaker expresses a sense of empowerment and moving on from the relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Dialogue/Argument:**\n",
      "    *   The male character pleads that his actions are just work and he still cares for the female character.\n",
      "    *   The female character appears to dismiss the explanation, indicating a lack of trust.\n",

      "In summary, the video seems to depict the aftermath of a broken relationship marked by infidelity, with the female character finding strength and expressing her anger through music or art.\n",
