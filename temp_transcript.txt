Welcome to MO's kitchen!
Today we are making KFC chicken.
I'll quickly show you what
ingredients you'll need.
Chicken according to your 
marinate.
Ahhh. We will be preparing 
fried potatoes to go with 
chicken.
They are peeled.
We will also need flour, milk, 
pepper, oil, salt, chili powder,
dill, garlic powder, sweet
paprika powder and eggs.
So.
I introduced what we will need.
Then we will show you 
how to make everything.
We will pour oil.
Wait, Romas.
What's it for now, right?
We will add potatoes to the
boiling oil.
We are slicing potatoes in
strings.
Which we are going to put in 
boiling oil.
The oil is not ready yet, but
it will be soon.
I have some time, so
I'll beat the eggs.
We'll add some salt.
That will be enough. It will be
too salty maybe.
We'll mix everything thoroughly.
We'll add some milk.
Give me that old milk. Romas.
...maybe shouldn't film.
I shall. I shall.
The oil is boiling, so we are 
adding the potatoes.
We will boil them until
they are yellow.
The sound of boiling oil –
the best sound in the world.
You are talking nonsense,
aren't you, right?
Yes.
I mentioned in the beggining
that you can choose your 
marinate. 
MO will tell what she used
for her recipe.
First of all, add some salt
on the chicken.
Vegeta spices, pepper, chicken 
spices, tumeric, you can also
add
green spices, the chicken
will be tastier.
How long do you usually 
marinate?
About 12 hours.
Okay, thank you.
You are welcome.
Film it.
Matas, I need...
Salt and dill. Potatoes are over
pot filled with hot water, so 
they don't get cold.
It's probably it.
Okay, we will prepare
the coating for the chicken.
We have added some flour.
MO is spinning ... Eh...
Grinding peppers.
Grinding peppers.
It's probably enough.
We have added some peppers.
We'll add some garlic powder.
Sweet paprika powder.
Don't add much.
Some chili powder.
Okay.
Do we need some salt, Romas?
We'll add some
We'll add some salt.
We'll mix everything thoroughly.
The most important moment, 
Take a piece of chicken.
And put it in...
Egg wash.
Mh.
And to the flour.
Again to egg wash.
And again to the flour.
Put into the oil.
Into egg wash.
Into the flour.
Into egg wash.
Into the flour.
Into the oil.
We will put as many
pieces as our pot fits.
Film it to show
how it looks right now.
The chicken is getting brownier
Soon it will be...
...fried.
Yes.
It will be cooked soon.
Tasty?
Hot.
It's only coating.
With marinated meat
it's different. This is...
So.
The chicken is getting
brownier.
We will soon take it out
and try it.
While granny is preparing
next...
...next batch.
Next batch.
As she says.
KFC is now in light brown 
colour.
And it's time to take it out.
7 pieces.
10 pieces.
And 2 more. So, 12 pieces
in total from one pot.
You may have a smaller pot,
so you'll put more.
Or you have a bigger pot...
...you'll put more.
You'll put some more.
And of course it depends
on how much oil you are 
willing to use.
Here you go.
I would like to mention
portion sizes.
So, two persons need around
1.5 kilos of chicken and
1.5 kilos of potatoes...
...to be full.
To be stuffed.
If we are serious, you'll
probably
2 kilos of chicken and
2 kilos of potatoes are
enough for 5 to 7 persons.
Depending on how stuffed
want to be and how much 
you usually eat.
You can eat KFC with
different sauces.
Hot sauce, ketchup or universal.
Cheers!
The most beautiful thing
in the world – KFC.
This is how fried KFC
looks like.
That's all, Terra.
How is it? Tasty?
Tasty,
For me?
I asked Matas.
I eat... F***.
What?! What?!
What are you doing?
Terra.
Give me the plate.
Don't film it, Romas. Those 
potatoes. That oil is black.
No. Yellow.
Okay, okay.
I'm telling you, MO, KFC
is the tastiest food for me.
It's very great to hear
such compliment.
What are we making for the 
next time?
Next time we will making 
zepellins.
Okay.
Thanks for watching.
That was MO who showed
you how to make KFC chicken.
We will be wainting for...
...feedback.
Feedback.
Granny is still preparing KFC.
For the next days.
We might eat.
After warming it up.
Today's results that I had
15 pieces.
 
Not 15, but 13 pieces
of chicken.
Could have I had more?
Yes.
Could have I had less?
Yes.
Thank you preparing it, MO.
It was very tasty.
Follow us and you might
see new...
Ahhh.
Recipes
New recipes.
So, see you!
Say goodbye, MO.
Goodbye – best wishes. Cheers!
So, hello and welcome to MO's
kitchen!
We will show three
easy popcorn recipes.
You'll need.
Corn seeds of course.
We will need salt for
one recipe.
Cheese powder for another.
The third one will need 
some honey, butter and sugar.
It's time to pop the
corn seeds.
First of all, we have to
prepare the corn seeds..
It doesn't matter how you
prepare them.
With a popcorn popper
or a pot.
We will skip this part.
We will only show the
recipes.
So, the popcorns are ready
now.
We will now prepare 3 
easy recipes.
Mix everything.
With what? F***.
With hands.
No. It's not good with hands. 
Probably not very hygienic.
Okay, the first recipe for
our homemade popcorns
is only with salt.
As I said the recipes will be
very easy.
This one is the easiest.
MO is putting some salt.
It's such an easy recipe.
We use cheese powder
for the next recipe.
Actually something like that
as I wasn't able to find real
cheese powder.
So, we will use cheese 
flavour dip sauce powder.
Cheese flavour. I think is 
almost the same. [It's not :D]
Granny is almost ready, 
Meanwhile I would like 
to say that
Popcorn is one of the healthiest
snacks.
Because they are full
of polyphenol
which neutralizes free radicals
...ehhh.... Free radicals are a 
type of molecules
which speed up the aging process
by damaging the cells.
In other words, if you
eat a lot of popcorn,
you will live very long.
At least it should be like that.
Ummm...
Now it's time to prepare our 
second recipe with
cheese powder.
Watch the end, to see how
to improve it, because it 
garbage right now.
I have to mention that popcorns 
have very little calories.
The most important thing
is what you put on them.
This is our second very easy 
recipe.
We are now preparing for the 
third and the hardest recipe
but definitely not hard.
First of all, we will add some 
butter for this recipe.
And we will melt it.
We have to add honey as well.
Mh.
Yes, yes.
We'll add sugar and honey
to the butter.
About 2 tablespoons of sugar.
Maybe a little bit more
we'll see how it looks.
Maybe some more of the butter?
Put it in?
Mh.
Wait until it boils.
It's fine. Everything's fine.
Our mixture is boiling.
We will boil it for 3-4 minutes 
until it becomes brown.
Light brown.
Then we will mix everything
with popcorns.
Our mixture is getting really 
brown
but we will wait some more.
Maybe you should mix it.
No. Like that.
We'll keep it a bit longer.
An we will pour it over
the popcorns.
The popcorns are coming.
So, our sauce is really brown.
Turn off the heating.
We will pour it over the 
popcorns.
Be very carefull while pouring
the sauce, it's very hot.
You can pour some then add some more.
What do you think?
Let's wait and we will 
"shoot".
You won't be able to clean it 
later.
Let's try with salt first.
Yes.
It's over there, isn't it?
Yes, there.
It's okay with beer.
Now with cheese powder or 
dip powder to be precice.
It's not good for me. 
To be honest I wouldn't 
recommend to try it with 
dip powder
because it's not cheese powder 
and
I was expecting different 
result.
It doesn't change the flavour and
it's not worth trying them.
I'm expecting the most 
from these.
As probably most of you.
So, let's try it, MO
The tastiest?
Probably.
Granny will like it as well
as grandpa and grandchildren.
It's definitely the tastiest
from three of these recipes.
Yes.
So, thank you for watching 
and wait for new episodes.
Say "goodbye", MO.
Goodbye! Best of luck!
Cheers!
So, we tried to mix dip powder with oil
and heat it.
We poured it over.
Compared to the previous 
try the rsults are rather great.
Much better when without oil.
If you want to try it, try it 
like that.
With oil, heat it, then pour
it over.
Thank you!
MO and I will prepare toffee
banana or caramelized banana.
We will need for this recipe.
Flour, corn flour, oil, water,
sesame seeds, sugar,
bananas, ice cubes
which are optional, but 
we will use them today.
At first we will make batter.
So, the main ingredient is 
flour, which you'll need 
around 190 ml.
Or around 100 g in other words.
That's enough.
Look.
Around... Add some more.
Around 190 ml.
Simple wheat flour.
We'll add some corn flour.
We'll need around 50 g or
80 ml.
Okay.
We'll mix everything.
And add around 190 ml of
water.
Just a litle above than this. 
Okay.
Add around a teaspoon of oil 
to the batter. And mix it of
course.
Add some oil.
It's not KFC, so it won't
be that long.
It will be fast. That's enough.
It will be quick.
That's enough. It's a nonsense.
Tell us what you are doing.
We peeled a banana, right?
We will cut it.
We will prepare for deep
frying.
Cut it in slant pieces.
Cut them.
Add around a teaspoon of oil 
to the batter. And mix it of
course.
We will now prepare some
bananas for deep frying.
Put it into the batter.
And then to the hot oil. 
It will not take long.
Take bananas out of the
pot when they get yellow.
Just want to remind to add 
some oil to the batter.
Do this.
This is how our first batch
looks like.
We will soon fry another
one.
Is it easier than KFC
or not?
Romas, you can get full from
KFC and this...
Is sweet food.
It's a dessert.
Of course it's easier, Romas.
MO is preparing the
last banana batch.
This is how they look.
But it's not the most
beautiful look.
Wait for the end to see how
they look finished.
We will use sugar to prepare
caramel.
We will need about 200 g.
Or in other words 250 ml. 
We will put 200 g of sugar
and prepare the caramel.
A few problems. While
making so much sugar
not all of it is able to melt,
while some of the rest
start getting black.
We recommend to make
the caramel from honey,
butter and sugar.
Our caramel is ready and 
we are adding bananas
Cover it in caramel and 
pu it in cold water to cool.
It's burning ;DD
Turn it down, Romas. It
will be black.
Child, it will be...
It's on the lowest heat.
I am turing it off then.
Look, that's happening.
I' m turing it off.
Okay, okay.
I think they are too brown.
You have to be very quick with
them
It's hard when there are two 
of us.
I mean when we get in each
others' way.
It's burning seriously.
They are a bit black.
Shut up.
I won't show all of it.
I'll cut it.
Maybe the second try will be
better.
Don't shout. You should not
have said that. Why did you say
that?
The last stage of the recipe
is to put some sesame seeds.
Our first try is on the right
side as you saw and
our much better second try
on the left side.
We hope that you will learn
from our mistakes and
you will do as well as we 
did on our second try.
Or...
He...
Or... Or... What did I want to
say?
Or you'll do it even better. 
That's it.
Why, MO?
It's a mess.
It might be better with honey 
and butter.
Yes... No. I think...
Don't pu it into the cold 
water, child. Put it nicely on 
the plate and that's it.
I think it would be better.
It's a mess with them. You have 
to know the sugar, child, as 
well.
It gets cold fastly.
Or prepare a hot bath
to put a pot on.
It's a mess with it.
Oh s***. I got electrocuted.
Look at this beauty.
It's definitely not hair.
This is how the fibres of 
caramel look like.
That caramel with honey and
butter is much easier to make
as the sugar takes so long to 
melt that it gets black in 
other places.
Right?
Yes.
Please, MO, "shoot".
You have to "eat".
What did you peel off?
Take whole.
Mmm. Mmm.
Very tasty.
I'll use this stick.
Amm.
Good?
Yes.
So.
Thank you, MO, for helping
to make it.
Actually it's really good.
We will eat these,
these will be for the guests.
So.
Thank you for watching again.
Wait for the new episodes
and new recipes.
See you!
Say goodbye, MO.
Goodbye.
Beaglesaurus, what are going
to eat?
It's very sweet, Terra. You
won't eat it.
What did Troja give to you?
Terra?
Cat food.
Did she eat?
She eat some of it.
Yeah?
It was good, wasn't it?
So, hello and welcome to MO's
kitchen!
On this episode Mo will show
how to make dumplings with
mushroom filling.
First of all we will make
mushroom filling.
So, we will need.
We have oil in the pan and 
we add a lot of onions to it.
Do we add it right now?
The oinions have to be cooked.
Oh.
We will wait for the onions to
cook.
Our onions are cooked.
We will add a mixture of
mushrooms.
What do we have here, MO?
Bots and what others?
Gyroporus.
Mh.
Boiled, dried.
Gyroporus and bots.
What now? Mix everything?
Mix. We wiil mix and cook.
How long does it take to cook?
I don't know, Romas.
Around 5 minutes.
Until they get even yellower
or what happens?
The bots won't get yellower.
No. Maybe the onions will
get yellower.
No?
There are half a litre
of boiled bots.
We will leave it to cook.
Where is our salt?
Here?
Yeah.
Here.
What will you add now, MO? 
Tell us.
Salt. What else could it be?
Salt and what? Pepper?
Pepper.
So.
No. Everything's fine.
Wait for me to.
Don't film it.
Okay.
While the mushrooms are 
cooling off
we will make batter.
Okay.
Now we are moving shortly to...
heh...
We are putting it to a different
container, right, MO?
Yes. To cool off.
Up next. We will make batter.
See you!
You shouldn't have said
"see you", little Romas.
Hello, good morning!
The second part of dumplings.
In which we will make batter.
What do you need to do, MO?
Flour, salt, water
Such simple batter.
The simpliest batter.
You can stop filming.
You might add some water to it.
Of course.
Then you have to show
how it looks, you know.
Keep adding water until
you reach a consistency 
as ours.
You will soon see how it
what it should be like.
So, we mixed it with water.
The consistency should
be something like this.
Now mangle it?
Right?
Yes.
Look. The table is ready.
A rolling pin. Hehe.
It's a shame it's not
different, 
but it is what it is.
You are mangling the batter
as well as a robot, MO.
You will also  mamgle well
after 22 years.
Our batter.
MO is washing her hands.
Stop it.
It will be like a small
pizza.
It will be a pizza with
mushrooms and onions. 
So, so. What's next to do?
The first step is to mangle
the batter.
Mh.
Very thinly, right?
Thinly.
Turn up the fire.
You can say that the oil
is being heated. 
Aha. Our oil is getting
hotter.
Such a beauty, right?
Yes.
Look.
So, take some mushrooms
and cover them with batter.
So it doesn't show up.
Yes.
How much to take?
A teaspoon?
That's enough.
So. "Shoot". Put them into
the boiling oil.
As the viewers have probably 
noticed your speciality is boiling
oil, MO.
"For sure".
It's because all of the dishes
are deep fried.
Where should I deep fry them,
then, in the water?
I don't...
I can show how to make in 
the water.
You can cook and show how
to boil in the water.
Some of them got bigger.
How long before they are ready?
Until they are yellow or what?
Until they get yellow.
Will all of them fit?
How long? A couple of minutes or
more?
More, Romas.
Maybe I won't add more as 
it gets difficult to flip them.
Are you flipping them now?
Yes, Romas.
One is side is getting bigger.
So, tell us.
They are ready!
Look at this colour.
To dry some oil off, right?
Mh.
Look.
The first batch.
Let's see if it's a quality
item.
If it's tasty.
Look. 
Mmm.
Oh.
It's very good.
This is how quality deep
fried product looks like.
Dumplings with mushroom
filling, right?
Yes.
So, what?!
Say "see you", MO.
See you! Happy holidays!
Okay, Hello everyone and
welcome to MO's kitchen,
Today we will be making as
MO says not paper sausages,
but home-made sausages.
What will we need, MO?
Minced pork meat.
Mh. 
What's here?
That's all kinds of my
dried herbs.
Here?
Peper, salt,  
basil,
marjoram. 
Mh.
That's it.
And also?
Is that sausages you 
have?
*Guts
We will put everything and mix.
Okay.
So, we will mix everything now.
For sure.
That's enough.
What kind of name is
that?
Oh come on...
It [name] was many years
ago.
Now it's my herbs.
All of them are dried.
What are they?
Celery, leek.
Umm. Those.
Pastinaca roots, parsley roots.
It's almost like home-made 
vegeta spice mix.
Yes. Yes.
Home-made vegeta spice 
mix.
We have basil here.
And... Marjoram.
So, we will mix everything.
Uh. We forgot to mention that 
we need some garlic. 
Cut in small pieces right, MO?
Yes
Would you put whole?
Mh.
Okay.
Won't you put all of them?
It will be too prominent.
Okay.
So, mix everything now.
Where did this three Xs salt
container from?
Is it an award for being the 
best chef?
Or?
Yes, for being the best...
Seriously what is it for?
It's a present for preparing 
a wedding.
Ah...
How many presents do you
have? A hundred? Probably
more.
I might have more than
a hundred.
Mh.
For preparing weddings.
Here look how mix product
looks like.
MO said it smelled very
well.
It's okay for me too.
It's not like those paper
sausages.
It's better.
Smell of home-made.
Yes, home-made.
So, what now? Take a gut.
Is it a pig gut?
What guts are here?
Small intestine?
Of course that's small
intestine.
Be serious, is that small
intestine?
Of course small intestine.
Large intestine are for 
Lithuanian potato sausages,
right?
Yes.
Okay, so.
For smoked sausages.
No. They are probably only for
Lithuanian potato sausage, 
Romas.
Mh.
So, we have here small sausages
of a pig.
I mean small intestine.
We will make sausages now.
MO puts a gut on this 
machine.
For making sausages.
It's actually a mincing machine
with an accessory.
Manual meat grinder.
Yes.
It's a good item. Doesn't
matter if it's old.
Is it old? Old item cannot be 
used?
No, I am just saying.
Turn it a couple of times.
Or more?
One time. Maybe two.
A couple turns and that's it.
Then, next sausage.
I see you have some posters,
MO, to decorate the walls,
right?
So, it's nice.
Why not?
So, it looks nice.
Why can't I decorate them?
Not only I can decorate, but
I can also buy them.
Yes.
For you they are free.
If there is a hole? Do 
you cut it off and that's it?
I won't cut it off. I will leave it.
Won't it burst?
Look.
I will push it.
Ah. You just move the hole,
right?
Yes.
What will burst?
You are skipping the hole.
What's wrong with bought
sausages?
I don't know, Romas. They
are full of something.
Some kind of nonsenses.
They are full of devils.
Those, Romas... Those...
Those, those.
Nitrites?
Not nitrites, but how they are
called.
Some s***. Artificial meat.
These home-made are better. 
Of course.
It's 100 times healthier.
A piece of meat is also
100 times healthier.
Yes.
Some cooked potatoes.
And you are full as a man.
Take some cucumber.
Jesus, Marry...
I ate three pickled cucumbers
today for dinner.
Romas.
Yes.
I didn't finish the breast. I 
ate one potatoe. I wanted 
something acidic.
Don't ask me.
Bought tomatoes are horrible
for me.
Especially in winter.
What's from bought things
are okay for you?
In spring, when Lithuanian 
cucumbers start, they have a 
nice smell, Romas.
Mh.
Tomatoes are horrible in
summer and winter for me.
The taste is different.
Is that correct, Romas?
Yes, yes.
They are bad. They may not
even exist.
Others eat them with a full
mouth.
More made sausages. There are...
17 sausages from how much meat?
1.5 kilos of meat.
Mh.
So, today we made sausages.
Tomorrow we will... Boil them.
And prepare some garnish
right?
Yes. Stewed, pickled cabbages.
So. Good. See you tomorrow!
It's not "see you tomorrow",
but in a second. Bye.
So, good morning, hello,
everyone!
We are here with MO... Ah...
Stewing some cabbages. Tell 
us MO, how to stew cabbages.
Tell us. I don't know.
What do we do to stew them? 
Add some water, cabbages,
carrots.
And add it on the fire to
stew for one hour.
I see.
On low heat and?
Leave it for about one hour.
Yes, to stew.
Good. After we finish stewing
we will boil the potatoes and
sausages, right?
Yes.
Okay.
Here are some stewed cabbages.
Almost ready potatoes. There
is nothing difficult here. 
Just put them to the water.
For how long?
How long did sausages
and potatoes take?
Sausages about 20 minutes. 
What about potatoes?
Potatoes until they are ready.
Until they are soft.
Mh.
We will soon put these not 
paper sausages and eat.
Look, MO. The soup is cooling
down. 
Next time you will have to show
how to make soup. 
Heh.
Full complex. Sausages, 
potatoes and cabbages.
So, it's time to try them.
It's very tasty, MO.
Thank you for tasty.
Yes.
The viewers can try it. I think
they won't be dissapointed
And, see you!
I forgot to say goodbye
normaly to MO.
Heh.
Thank you, MO and say goodbye.
To the viewers.
Thank you for following my
show.
Yes.
Until next time.
See you!
I and MO would like to truly 
thank you for watching
and we hope that you will
continue watching our show.
Big thanks.
And see you. Say goodbye again, 
MO, if you want to.
Goodbye!
Okay, goodbye!
Hello, everyone, and welcome to 
MO's kitchen.
On this episode we and MO will 
be making pancakes, right?
Pancekes with meat filling.
With vegetables and meat.
Mh.
To make these pancake, we will 
first need to make filling, 
right?
Yes.
What do we have here? What will 
we need?
Onions, cabbages, sweet chilli
powder MO's spices of dried 
vegetables,
carrots, celery, right?
Celery roots.
Celery roots, garlic and what 
kind of meat?
Two boiled chicken thighs and 
some pork.
Mh.
Boiled and minced, right?
Yes.
Here.
Turn on the heat.
MO says to add some oil.
Not much, right?
Pour it.
So much?
That's it.
Okay.
Okay.
Let it heat up.
What now? MO adds some cabbages.
Carrots.
Celery roots.
Chopped onions.
How much time until it's
done, when it's mixed, MO?
Until vegetables are soft.
Mh.
Around 10 minutes.
Not enough, Jolanta.
You think 15 minutes?
I don't know, Romas.
Now, we will add chopped onions,
little Romas
Mh.
To stew them little bit.
You will add some spices, right? Later?
When we add meat, we will
add some spices.
Ah, okay.
We will mix and...
Yes, yes.
stew for a little longer.
Yeah, yeah.
So, the garlic gets soft.
You don't need to stew them for
long.
Say "vegetables are ready".
Say, say. Vegetables and
onions are ready.
I mean garlic... Now add some
meat.
How much meat is here? 1 kilo?
A good kilo, Romas.
Half vegetables, half meat,
right?
Yes.
Maybe there are more 
vegetables, what do you think?
Vegetables are stewed, Romas.
Mh.
Probably the same amount.
Full pan.
For two persons to be full.
Oh, come on.
For 10 persons.
Add some peppers.
Mix everything thoroughly,
right?
Yes.
Give me some sweet chili powder.
The peppers are not coming
out  
They are. Look closer.

Should I give you your glasses?
No need for that.
Maybe I should give them to you.
It looks like a lot.
I will give you your glasses,

I don't need them.
Won't it be too hot?
No.
Look.
Sweet chili powder.
It's hot here.
What did you say?

And some salt.
That's it, right?
We will mix everything, fry it 
a bit longer and the meat will

Don't put everything.
Some salt.
Look at this robot mixing,
The robot mixed the batter.

So, it's really tasty.
So, thank you for making, MO.
I see you have some gifts...

Thank you for not forgetting to

Simple chicken.
It's simple. We will add some

Mh.
Carrots finished stewing, we are

Around a glass of water, maybe
a bit more.
Some peppercorns.

Not many.
And some bay leaves, right?
We won't add many as you know...

I will add garlic individually 
on every piece.
Mhm.
Mix everything well.
Yes.
Maybe you shouldn't mix it 
by hand I'll get kitchen

Oh come on! What will you mix?
The machine won't reach it.
Heh.
Now put some spices on 
every piece.
How long to marinate it roughly?
We will marinate it overnight.
It's cold outside. We will put it 
in cold.
And some garlic on each piece.
You know, MO, where all of this
taste comes from? From the
work.
If you work a lot, it will be
tasty.
Yes, the most important is to
enjoy this work.
Don't be lazy.
If you didn't like it, you
would never do it.
This is how our rubbed chicken
looks like. We will wait for
tommorow and cook it.
Yes.
We will leave it overnight to
marinate.
So, good morning! Our chicken
marinated,
now we wlll...
Pour some oil on the baking
tray.
Not much, MO, right?
Of course not much.
We will cook it and that's it.
Let's put meat pieces on.
These are not pieces, they
are quarters.
Will you cover them?
Mmm. Some salt.
We will put some potato
spices on peeled potatoes.
I think it's not opened.
Speak, don't be afraid.
And some salt.
Put everything on, you 
can't throw anything away.
That's it.
Open the oven, we'll put
it in.
Mhm.
So, the oven is at 190 C
[370 F].
We are using upper heating
program.
Right, mum?
The first section. The lowest.
She said to put it on the 
bottom.
On the bottom section.
The program is called upper
heating, right?
Ehh. No, little Romas, Thermal
cooking.
It's called thermal cooking
after all.
But of course you can use
different program.
But we like these settings.
This is how a hen is cooking.
A rooster.
Yeah, it could be.
We will prepare carrots for the
chicken.
First of all, here we some
peeled ones.
MO will beautifully grate them.
A cup of water, so the chicken
don't burn.
MO is preparing, chopping  
some garlic.
For the carrots.
Yeah, we'll put it here.
We'll put it into one "bowl".
Yes.
How to properly say "bowl"
in LIthuanian?
I don't know, I can't remember.
It must be "bowl".
There is something
different.
Later.
Will you mix later?
Yeah, yeah, I have to bring
some mayonnaise from my
home. You have some too.
You speak.
Speak, speak.
The chicken is cooking and
it looks nice.
It will be ready soon.
Mhm.
It will be ready in 10 minutes.
Mh. It has... How long did it take to 
warm up the oven?
Around 10 minutes, so it has
been cooking for around 1 hour
20 minutes.
We'll see how much will it need, 
but about 10 minutes probably.
We will now prepare carrot salad.
It's salad, isn't it?
Yes, vegetable salad.
Mayonnaise, garlic and 
carrots.
The easiest dish.
Tasty and healthy.
Yes.
Mayonnaise is probably not 
that healthy.
Garlic for winter, Romas.
Our chicken is ready, it's 
time to take it out.
It have been cooking for
around 1 hour 45 minutes.
It looks nice, right, MO?
Very.
Here it goes.
Why are you laughing?
Who's laughing? MO?
Yeah.
She's happy.
Now it's time to try it.
Wait, I'll put some...
Mh.
Okay, I'll wait until you put
all of them.
So, MO, we'll see if it's
tasty.
Your bowl is full of sauce.
Just a little bit.
It's very tasty as usual.
The vievers will definitely
be happy if the make by this
recipe.
So, thank you and until next time.
Right, MO?

Don't film window sills
They are disgusting.
Mh.

it starts boilling.
Rice are raw, cabbage is raw
will take some time to simmer.
Will you fill it to the top?
So, that it covers them.
Here. Let it simmer. That's
it.
This is how our Polish cabbage
patties are simmering.
The water is boiling, so we can
lower the heat. We will move to
another hole.
Those handles are hot, you 
can't take them without any
cloth.
But you just did.
I did, yeah. But I could carry 
it anywhere far.
Kotliets are done. Tell us what

we will add some flour.
Butter and flour. Is that it?
Yes and ketchup.
Mh.
The butter is almost melted,
we will add some flour.
How many spoons?
Two will be enough.
I see some sort of liquid here.
What will we do with it?

We will pour it to the pot.
It's from kotlets. We will heat
it, mix it.

So, hello again and welcome to
MO's kitchen. On this episode
...
The first time in history of this
show, we're making a soup.
One of my favourite soups-
Sweet Soup.
So, why don't you, MO, tell us
what it needs.
Some frozen berries.
Tell us what kind of berries.
Strawberries, raspberries,
gooseberries, blackcurrants.
Mh.
Sugar, pasta, starch.
Let's say a large teaspoon of
starch, right?
Yes.
Okay... Yeah. I would also like
to mention that all of these
goodies are from granny's
garden. Grown and taken
care of.
The tastiest.
That makes them the tastiest.
So, the water is boiling.
No. Wait. Yes, it's boiling.
So, we'll add some pasta now.
That' will be enough.
They'll boil for about 5
minutes.
The pasta is almost done, so
we'll add all the goodies now.
And we'll also add a couple
tablespoons... How many? A
couple? More?
We'll probably need more. It's
a rather large pot.
And we'll wait for it to boil.
Then we'll add some some starch
and the soup we'll be done.
Look at your beauties swimming
in the water.
In the soup, not in the water.
Yes, yes.
Granny has dissolved some
starch in the water.
In the cold water, so we could
add to the soup later.
The soup has started boiling,
so we'll add some starch slurry
now.
Okay, that's enough.
Don't you want to add more?
No.
The soup has boiled. That's it!
It's ready!
Let it be tasty and respect it.
Bon appétit!
So, MO will add one of my
favourite soups.
Look at this beauty.
Strawberries and gooseberries.
Blackcurrants and raspberries.
Mh.
A pallet of Lithuanian berries.
We've to wait for it cool off a
bit. And then we'll try it.
The soup has cooled off and
now I'll try it.
Sweet and sour. Very tasty!
So, thank you for making it, MO!
I think the viewers will
definitely like it!
Thanks to those who watched it
and bye!
MO?
Bye!
It's really good when you have
our own berries.
Of course it's good.
But of course you have to work
hard for that.
It's nothing. Don't let the
weeds grow and there won't
be a lot of work.
So, welcome, everyone to

Once right?
Twice then.
Ah, then again later.
Again one more time...

Okay, nevermind. Into the rusks.
One is already ready to

Here are 12 Kiev chickens ready
to swim oi...
in the hot oil.
The potatoes are boiling.
The oil is heating up.
Peas with some milk in.
Mh.
Let's put some butter in.

the butter?
I'll add some more.
Peas, carrots and butter and milk.
Some flour.
A handful or more?
It will be enough, Romas! No

A good spoon will make the
sauce thicker.
A spoon sour cream, more?
A little bit more. It will be
tastier.
The oil is heated up. MO is
putting ckicken Kiev in
to deep fryyyyyy!
I think we should lower the
heat.
Should I lower the heat?
This one, right?
Yeah.
I won't put any more.
Okay.
... it will be enough.
How long will they deep
fry, MO?
I think about 5 minutes,
Romas.
We will make mashed
potatoes now.
How do you manage to
do everything, MO?
Do it faster and you'll do it
as well.
Here are the beauties.
They are not up yet, Romas.
When they are up, it
means...
No, no...
They are not ready.
Let me get a piece of cloth.
Tell us what's going on with
the milk.
The milk is being boiled for
the mashed potatoes.
You have to boil it, right?
Yes.
That's necessary.
So it boils?
Yes.
The potatoes are finishing.
Such a nice tray made by
a grandson.
By grandson. The most
important thing is that it's
by grandson.
Explain, MO, how to make
mashed potatoes for those
who are making it for the time.
First of all, peel, wash
the potatoes well.
And boil, right?
Boil, add some salt and
then smash with a rolling
pin.
Mh.
And then add boiled milk.
Milk, butter.
That's it?
Mashed potatoes.
The potatoes are smashed. We
have to add some butter now and
mix well.
The milk is almost boiling.
It will be boiling soon.
There is some milk in.
Mix everything well and if 
needed more, we'll add more.
Yes.
We might need or not.
We'll drink this milk later
then.
You'll drink.
You can't throw anything away,
MO.
Yes. Nothing. You'll drink
it with cereal when it's not
so hot.
It's very thick.
Mashed potatoes are ready.
Chicken Kievs are also...
Are finishing.
Finishing.
You boiled a real beauty...
Deep fried...
And now it's time to try
this beauty.
Did the butter come out?
Mh.
There are some butter inside
Kiev chicken and it runs out.
That's why it's so tasty.
Will Matas eat?
I don't know. I didn't ask.
So, thank you, MO, for
making this delicious meal.
Hehe. You are running from
that spot, right?
Amm... I and viewers [MO] would
like to thank you again for

tasty dishes such chicken Kievs.

Salt and oil.
Salt, oil, eggs.
We'll fry onions and carrots
on low heat.
So, they'll get soft, Romas.
...
When they're fried what will we
add? Some salt, pepper and
maybe some dried herbs.
Mix everything well.
We'll mice the meat now.
Mincing machine is not bad,
Of course it's not bad.
Vegetables have fried. Will you
add some salt or what will you
do?
We'll add some salt, pepper.
Pepper.
And some celery.
We'll need to mix everything
well. First we'll add some salt.
All spices.
Eggs.
We're grating the cheese.
We're adding some
mayonnaise
We're mixing everything.
So, what are you doing?
Pouring the oil in?
Yes, I'm pouring some, so
it wouldn't stick.
Oh, the cutlets are ready.
What do you mean "they are
ready"? Oh...
I mean they are formed. We
have some...
Stuffing here.
Stuffing. I see some caraway
here. And... Cheese with
mayonnaise?
Yes.
I'll make 1 soon.
Take some meat, right?
Add some carrots and onions
on top.
Then some mayonnaise and
cheese.
We'll add those...
Some caraway.
Some caraway, so they look
nicer when they are done.
A person not only eats... With
how to say a tongue, but also
with eyes, right, MO?
When it looks nice, it's much
tastier.
Yes, a lot tastier.
The cutlets are ready here. We
made a nice number - 15, so
they fit nicely!
I think it's  rather clear that 
granny is a real professional
and... She manages to calculate
very well how much she'll need
of everything.
All we have to do now is put
it in and we'll cook them,
right, MO?
How long will we...
Half an hour.
Half an hour.
Maybe a little bit more.
The potatoes are finishing
boiling. We'll now take the
cutlets out.
How long have they been
coooking? Just a little bit more
than half an hour.
Yes, yes. You see how nicely
they roasted.
Mh.
They're cooked.
Maybe she'll come. Here we have
a potato.
Mh. And a cutlet.
Here.
And now... How to say... The
most pleasurable moment
of my filming is tasting.
Wait...
The cabbages really suit the
cutlet.  What's that? Fermented
cabbages, aren't they?
Fermented cabbages.
Yes.
Some onion, oil and it's really
tasty.
Mh.
Fermented cucumbers as well.
So! Thank you, MO, for your
usual tasty preparation of food.
And.
And so... I would like to... We
can say bye to the viewers.
Thank you, viewers, and bye!
Bye!
Good morning, everyone, hello,
MO!
Good morning!
Heh. Grandmother is saying

The dish is English breakfast.
We'll need to make.
Bacon, sausages, tomatoes,
eggs, champignons, butter,
white bread whic we'll toast,
dill, beans, oil, pepper, salt.
You can use blood sausage,
but...
We won't use it for this recipe.
Mh.
Cover the sausages in oil.
And we'll put them in the oven.
Mh.
We'll cook it for 5 minutes.
The temperature is set to 190 C
[370 F].
Agh... The sausages have been
cooking for about 5 minutes.
We'll add the bacon 
and we'll cook it for about 5
minutes as well.
We're turning the bacon over.
Prrrrruuuuph.
We're adding some champignons.
And we'll also cook them for 5
minutes.
Tomato preparation. Cut it in
half and take the green part
out.
We'll make 2 tomatoes...

And toast them.
The toasts are ready, so we're

A bit more than 10 minutes
have passed and now it's
time to take everything out.
The sausages exploded, but
that's okay.
It's really hot.
Full baking tray!
Bacon...
Our plate is too small...
We'll have to put everything in.
Maybe you shouldn't pour it
out.
Or pour it?
It won't fit. It's okay.
Look!
Everything's in.
Okay.
We have to move it over there.
Doesn't it look good, MO?
Very beautiful!
We'll add some dills now.
So, it's time to try it. I'm
sure everything we'll be very
tasty here.
I won't do this eating part
today, because it would take
ages for me to try evertyhing,
so...
MO? Thank you for watching!
Hehe.
Thank you for making it.
Aha... So...
What would you like to say
to your viewers, MO?
Until next time and let it be

A "joke".
Why is it a "joke" if it works?
With a handle, comfortable.
The cake won't be small.
Not small, no.
What are you doing?
Tell us.
It's required.
So, it evaporates
And you are putting for cooking?
Yes.
Mh.
How long does one cook?
About 5 minutes.
Then later you use these
cut-offs again to form sheets.
Yes, I wouldn't throw away.
Look a this quality.
How many do you think
you'll make?
13 or 14
We'll see if you are right.
No, no, no.

What are we doing next?
We'll trim the edges, so
they are even.
We'll crush left-offs and

The sheets are ready.
They are baked and now
we'll cover the cake.
What are we going to use?

citric acid.
Some lemon flavour, so it
would have a lemon scent.
A few drops, right?
We'll mix everything.
We'll mix until hard foam.
Sour cream is done.
So, how do we cover
the cake, MO?
Take a spoon of cream.
Mh.
And cover the sheet evenly
Yes.
Then the next sheets.
Press lightly.
Yes, but not much.
And again a couple of spoons
of cream.
I'll start with the top
then move to the bottom.
Roughly edges. Not completely. 
Because we still have some
sheets. Roughly.
The last level.
Even everything out. Top and
sides.
We are now sprinkling 
over the cake.
These grumps are from one sheet.
Which was left.
Yes. You crush with a 
rolling pin and that's it.
You crush it and you have
what you have,
The cake is covered with
cream and crumbs.
We will decorate the
top of it now.
So, how to use it?
Cut it in half and?
That's unnecessary
I can't see without the glasses.
Do you peel off thin stripes?
You'll see how I do.
So, the orange is ready.
What are you going to do now?
In half?
In half. 
Mh.
Look, Romce.
We have a cut off pattern
Of course you can make your own
patters.
For instance, happy birthday
or something.
And do a simple text.
Leaves with one colour.
Middle with different colour.
Or how?
Now one.
We are taking of the pattern.
Look.
Such a nice flower.
Rotate it a bit, right?
Yes.
It will be two coloured.
Two coloured bloom.
I mean two coloured leaves
And we are taking it off.
How beautiful.
Are you putting orange
decorations now?
So, the cake is ready.
Such a beauty.
We won't be eating it right now.
We will wait for tomorrow's
celebration.
And you'll see
how it looks.
But you won't need to wait.
So.
Thank you for now and
see you!
See you!
You can make a cake
for February 16.
Yes. Great opportunity to try it.
From Lithuanian items.
To make it.
Okay. So, thank you again

The cake is being cut and
will be tasted.
Cut some for me, Mum.
Here it is.
This is how the cake looks.
How many layers?
How many layers there had been?
14 or 13, something like that?
There 12 layers., Romas.
12, so 12.
Now it's time to try it.
I like granny's picture.
We will taste it.
So.
Very beautiful.
I'll bring some to
the work to taste it.
We aren't many.
We are only four.
Tasty.
Did you put some cacao in?
No.
No, Algutis. It's
the spices.
How many kilos?
Now it's your turn, MO.
Please, no.
Okay.
So, thank you, MO,
for the tasty cake. 
For making honey cake.
So, thank you viewers
for watching and see you!
See you!
Don't film, little Romas,
I look like a scarecrow.
Mh.
Be nice!
Good morning. What will we
make today, MO?
We will make stuffed cabbages
for dinner.
What will we need to make?
First of all, a cabbage.
Mh.
Pork meat, salt, chopped onions,
rice. Spices: minced pork spices,
peppers, basil,
and my dried herbs and carrots.
We will now take the stem
of the cabbage out, right?
Yes.
Some salt to the water.
Yes.
We'll add a cabbage when the 
water boils.
Whole?
Yes.
Whole. You haven't seen how
to make cabbages... those
stuffed cabbages, Romas!
Probably I haven't.
Put it in.
Oh.
I'll put them in until
the cabbage boils.
It's around half a cup
of rice.
Mh.
Here we have 1.5 kg [3.3 lb.] 
of meat.
Add in all spices and onions.
Yes.
Some salt.
Is Mickey Mouse ready?
You are Mickey Mouse,
Mickey Mouse.
Heh.
Is the cabbage ready?
We'll see. We can take them
off.
Ahh.
They are coming off.
We will now take all of them
off.
We won't be able to yet.
Only the outer layers.
Yeah.
Ready!
Okay, what are you doing?
I will add some cabbage to the
bottom of the pot.
For the taste.
I like stewed cabbage.
Without the meat.
We'll add some carrots.
Mh.
To stew together.
Yes, yes.
We will cut the thick part out.
Mh.
And how to make it? Take
a piece of meat.
Roll it in.
Here, look.
Into the pot.
Press it, so it doesn't unfold,
right?
Then they stick more or less.
Put the folding line at the 
bottom.
How many will you make? 20?
Probably 20.
So, we'll add some salt and 
water, right?
It's hot water, isn't it?
That's enough of water.
A few peppers.
We'll leave for stewing. How
much time is left?
Oh.
I think probably an hour, child.
It will definitely be an hour
as it has boil.
Mh.
Some herbs?
Yes. It will be tastier.
They stewed. What will you
do here, MO?

ketchup.
Mh.
And some sour cream.
Some flour.
Tomato ketchup.
Stuffed cabbage liquid.
But you didn't say what's in
here. Potatoes?
Potatoes are boiling. What could
it be?
Here.
Not everyone has tried making
stuffed cabbages. They don't
know.
The sauce is ready.
What... What will we do now, MO?
We will put it over the stuffed 
cabbages.
That one.
Yes.
Pour it over then.
What will people do if
they don't know? Add
some.
Will you add some sour cream?
Yes, some and some...
Okay.
Just a little bit, Romas.
So it won't be that thick.
Mhm.
And some sour cream.
Move it a bit.
We'll add some celery and
stuffed cabbages are ready.
Everything's ready, now we
put everything in.
Do I add 2 for you?
One at first.
I might need about 5 though.
I'll try some now.

The stuffed cabbages are 
really tasty. Come here if you
don't want...
to be in your corner.
So?
So?
What will you say?
What do want to for the 
viewers... say to the
viewers?
Let it be tasty.
Until the next time.
I would like to thank
subscribers. There are 20
of them at the moment.
Maybe we didn't think
that there might be even
20 viewers, but...
there are 20 of them. It's not
bad.Thank you and 
until the next time. Bye!
Bye!
Wait, Romas. When I'm adding
it to the plate you shoot
a closeup.
No, right now some closeups
of you.
Come on!
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello!
Heh.
On this episode we're making...
Agh... Apple Oat Pancakes.
We'll need to make them.
Of course apples, eggs, sugar,
wheat flour, oats, milk and oil.
1.5 cups of oats.
2 cups of milk.
We will pour it over and leave
for 2 hours to expand.
We're grating the apples here.
Beat the eggs.
You're doing nothing.
Okay, I'm beating.
I'm beating the egg.
Your hands are better for these
kind of things, MO.
Concentrate on how you do it
and not others. Just do it!
This is how professionals
beat the eggs.
What will you add?
Some salt.
Salt.
Into the oats which have been
setting in for about 2 hours.
And some sugar.
How many?
A tablespoon and some more.
That will be enough. Our apples
are not sour.
A cup of flour.
Mix everything well.
We're putting the apples in.
And some eggs.
Mix everything well.
Pancake dough is mixed.
We'll put them in and fry.
It has to heat up...
Do 1 large pancake over all
pan.
How will I turn it over, Romas?
With your hands.
Come on...
Some oil...
Is it hot enough, little Romas?
What do you think?
It is.
You think so?
Mh.
So, we're putting the pancake
dough in.
The pancakes are frying.
We're turning the pancakes
over. The have fried nicely.
They smell really well, right,
MO?
Yes, really.
For sure!
So, the pancakes are
finishing frying.
We're putting them into the
plate.
Mh.
Please, try them now.
I'm going.
My...
Pancakes...
You can eat these pancakes with
sour cream or jam, or without
anything.
But I will... The jam will be
enough, because I prefer
it like that.
Very tasty pancakes, MO.
Very much?
Mh.
Okay.
Pancakes for Užgavėnės.
Mh.
Thank you, MO, for making it.
It's very nice to hear that.
Hm...
Am... So, people, you can really
make these pancakes and wait
for... How to say...
Užgavėnės.
Užgavėnės. All sort of devils,
witches who come to your
home asking for pancakes.
Heh...
You won't... Be dissapointed,
nor will they. So, thank you for
watching and bye!
Cheap and tasty, right?
Mh.
You can say bye, MO!
Bye!
Hehe.
They were really tasty
especially when you consider
it was our first time making
them.
Yes.
Yes.
Very tasty pancakes.
Okay, hello, everyone! On this
episode we're making Blowed-
Cheek Pancakes, right, MO?
"Yeast Pancakes".
They're called Blowed-Cheek
Pancakes
"Blowed-Cheek Pancakes"?
Yes, we'll be making Yeast
Pancakes and we'll need to
make them.
Eggs. Ahh...
Sugar,
Sugar, wheat flour, yeast,
raisins and here we have a
sort of mixture prepared.
Well, it's not a mixture...
But...
Milk with water.
Some water has been added,
so the milk wouldn't be as cold
as ice from the fridge.
It has to be a bit warmer.
So, we're adding a about 20 g
[0.7 oz.] of yeast.
Will you add some water, so
it would stay?
No, we'll add some sal...
Sugar.
Some yeast, Romas.
So the yeast would multiply and
expand.
So that the yeast would 
dissolve.
Maybe we'll add some room
temperature water.
And about a half cup of water? 
Something like that.
Yes.
This is how much I've added.
Mix everything well, right?
And how long to keep it?
You can use them just after
they've dissolved into the water
... To prepare the dough.
We're adding some flour.
Here we have a kilo [2.2 lb]
of flour.
Probably more.
Some salt.
Yeast.
They're bubbling. The reaction
is taking place.
We'll add 2 tablespoons of
sugar.
[Or a little bit more ;D].
That's enough of sugar. There
is no need for a lot of it.
We're beating the eggs.
We're adding some flour.
Yeast.
Some raisins.
And some milk, little Romas.
Oh, some milk.
So.
[And mix everything.]
The dough is ready.
What will you do with it now?
We'll do... We'll put it a warm
place for 2-3 hours, so it would
expand and then we'll fry them.
Mh.
The watchers see the level of
the dough. We'll see how much
it will expand to.
Maybe it'll even come out of
the...
Bowl. Yes...
This is how the dough should
look like.
As I said the dough is pretty
much getting out of the...
Container.
But it hasn't come out yet.
What are we doing now? Will
we fry them?
We'll fry them very soon.
We're adding some oil. We'll
heat the pan a bit, right?
Yes, we wouldn't put them into
the cold one.
We're adding some. A tablespoon?
Maybe just a little bit more?
A taaaablespoon is enough.
The pancakes are frying.
The pancakes have fried.
I'll turn them over, so one side
would fry a bit more.
So, it's time to try them.
I don't know if you can eat them
so hot.
I'll eat them don't worry.
I...
I like this one.
Okay, I'll wait a bit, so they'd
get a bit colder.
Yes, wait. Add some jam...
Okay, okay, I personally like to
eat with strawberry jam.
Those are crushed strawberries.
MO made and grew them.
It should be tasty.
I'll try some now.
Mm. It's definetely tasty. You
know, MO, when gypsies and
sort of devils come tomorrow,
so when they say to each other,
they brake through the doors
[for the pancakes].
Hehe... OKay.
Heh. Okay, we'll make more
pancakes tomorrow. These
won't be enough.
Mh. Okay, thank you, MO. It was
really delicious. Thank you
viewers those...
Like, share, subscribe and so
on.
So, thank you and bye!
Bye!
You made a pyramid, MO!
Yes.
How many are there? Have you
counted?
No, I haven't.
Too much work, right?
Yes, too much work. At least I
put them on the plate.
Okay. Hello, everyone, hello,
MO!
Good morning!
Amm... On this episode we're
making Fish Casserole and
to make it...
Did I say it wrong?
Yes, yes.
Mh. To make it we'll need
fish.
Aaah... Egg, cut carrots,
onions. Ahh... Pepper, some
dried vegetable mix.
Caraway, salt and we'll also
need fish spices which we
don't have on the table.
We forgot to mention before
that we'll also need mayonnaise,
cheese
and those fish spices I mentioned
before.
We're pouring some oil in.
We're pouring the carrots in.
We'll also cut the onions, put
them in and fry them until the
vegetables are soft.
We're cutting the onions and
putting them in to fry with
carrots.
How long will we fry them for,
MO?
At least 20 minutes or even
half an hour.
Carrots and onions are fried
and cooled off.
You'll make thinner...
Yes, yes.
So the pieces are about the same
thickness.
Yes, thickness, because it's
large as a mountain.
Some oil.
Some salt.
Some dried herbs.
And some pepper.
We'll cook it for 15-20 minutes
in the oven, so it would cooked
a bit.
Mh. What's the temperature?
We'll see if that's enough or
not. It's still cold.
Maybe set it to 200 C [390 F],
Romas.
200 C [390 F].
Yeah.
We're adding some herbs,
peppers and some caraway as
well.
And mix everything well.
Not yet, Romas. We'll add an
egg, salt.
Some salt.
An egg.
Some peppers.
And mix everything well.
We're grating the cheese.
It had been cooking for almost
40 minutes.
Look how little there's left
from a large baking tray.
Mh. It has shrunk.
It was so thick and...
We'll add some vegetables on
top.
Vegetables are on. We'll add
some cheese on now.
The cheese is on. We're adding
some mayonnaise now.
Even it out.
We'll smooth the surface and
then put it in the oven.
Fish cake as I said is prepared.
We'll put it in to cook.
Ngh, ngh...I don't know how
long it'll take. Probably about
20 minutes.
We'll have to look.
Yes.
Our fish is done. This is how it
has to look. Roasted.
And we've been cooking for a bit
more than 30 minutes.
You see, Romas it was really
thick.
Of course if you were to cook
a thinner fish, it would take
less time.
Yes, yes, it will be faster.
I want to mention that you can
eat it hot, but we'll wait for
tomorrow's celebration
and then we'll try it.
This is how prepared fish looks
like. Now I'll try a piece of it.
Tasty, very tasty.
What will you eat it with? White
vegetable salad?
Probably.
Okay, MO. Thanks for this
tasty dish.
Okay.
Thank you for watching!
You are welcome!
And bye, watchers!
Bye!
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello! 
So, on this episode we're
making chicken drumettes with
honey and barbecue sauce.
To make them we'll of course
need some chicken, flour, honey,
barbecue sauce, salt.
Agh... Garlic powder sweet red
paprika, some chili powder and
pepper.
1 kilo [2.2 lb] of chicken needs
about half cup of flour.
We're pouring the flour in.
Salt.
Table... Teaspoon.
Teaspoon not tablespoon.
Mh. A teaspoon.
A teaspoon of chili powder.
A teaspoon of sweet chili
powder.
A teaspoon of garlic powder.
And also a teaspoon of pepper.
Do you think I ground in there?
However you can do.
Mix everything.
Take a chicken drumette, cover
it in the mixture of flour and
spices and
put them on the baking tray
to prepare for cooking
So, the chicken is in. We'll
now put them in to cook them.
The program is called upper and
lower cooking [heating].
And the temperature is set to
200 C [430 F].
And we'll cook for about 45
minutes, but after...
Wait, little Romas. Oh yes, it's
45 minutes.
Yes, yes and after about 20
minutes we'll turn the chicken
over.
And then we'll cook them for
another 20 minutes.
So, about 45 minutes in total,
but we might less or more.
Okay, take the chichen. We'll
turn it over now.
Mm. It'll be fine.
We've been cooking for about 35
minutes.
We turned the chicken over and
we'll cook it for 10-15 minutes
more.
On the bottom?
While the chicken is cooking,
we'll mix the sauce. It'll need
for about a kilo [2.2 lb] of
chicken we'll need a half cup
of barbecue sauce
and 1/4 cup of honey.
Liquid honey, little Romas.
Mh.
Liquid honey is better,
because it's much easier
to mix it.
Yes, because honey won't
dissolve in this sauce. 
We're pouring honey in and
of course we'll mix everything.
We've been cooking the chicken
for another 6 minutes and we're
taking it out now.
So the chicken has been cooking
for about 45 minutes in total.
A little bit longer.
Here it is.
5 minutes more doesn't mean
anything.
Yes.
Take the chicken now and
put into our prepared sauce.
We'll put everything in and...
Mix the chicken in the sauce.
And now we're putting the
chicken back into the baking
tray.
The chicken is in. Now we're
putting it back into the oven.
The temperature is set to
200... I mean 260 C [500 F].
And we'll cook it...
For 8... From 8 to 10 minutes.
Have you been sleeping?
The chicken is finishing
cooking.
Wroop...
Wroop...Wroop...Wroop...
And we'll take it out.
It's hot.

Okay, we'll increase the
heating, so the oil heats up.
We're using white bread, but

Cut it in such pieces.

30.
Mh. Was it a good job?
Good.
But you were the first to come,
right?
Yes.
And what did you do? Made
coffee for the chef?
No, first of all I would turn
all ovens on.
There had been huge pots
which I had to turn on.
Then we would go to change.
Our changing room was in the
basement to change.
After we changed our clothes, we
would go to the storage room
to pick the products and lift
them by the elevator.
We would bring everything.
Then we would drink coffee and
then we would start working.
What was the time in the morning
when you come to the work?
5:10.
And when does the work start?
At 6:00.

In gauze.
Mh.
And squeeze it, right?
Yes, yes. Learn it, so that you
could show it to your wife when
you have one.
But you don't have to completely
squeeze everything out?
No, of course not. How will
you...
So... That there's some...
Liquid left.
Yes, yes.
Here look.
Here.
This is how much you should
squeeze the potatoes to.
Here.
We'll pour the liquid to the
other container, so that the
starch could set
Which we then put into our
mixture when we mangle.
The potatoes are squeezed out.
Here we have some potato
water.
There the starch will set.
Is it starch here?
Yes.
Mh.
Such nice quality! Is that it?

We'll also add some boiled
potatoes.
Mh...  We're adding some
boiled potatoes.
We're adding some starch.
Some salt.
And mangle the mixture.
We're mangling everything well.
The mixture is ready!
We're grounding some pepper

Now it's better.
I was told to add a lot of
peppers.
Yes, it needs a lot of peppers.
Of course don't be too crazy,
but yeah, it needs a lot.
This is what's so special about
them - they're rather hot these
zeppelins.
In other words "Kakaražukai".
Cooked zeppelins.
Okay, that's enough, Romas,
it'll too hot.
Mix everything well now.
Add some oil to the baking
tray.
We'll form a "kakaražukas" now.
How to do it, MO?
Just simply.
But how? Take some batter,
right?
Yes. Put some stuffing inside.
And?
Here. You'll make a zeppelin.
I would like to say that I heard
about this recipe from my other
grandmother, not MO, but
Kėdainiai grandmother, so if you
are watching, then the best
wishes to all that area around.
Look at these nice capsules.
Our kakaražukas. Here we have

To see if they're cooked.
We'll put it into the oven now.
The temperature is set to 200 C
[390 F].
Open it.
The program is called upper

We'll see how long it'll take
to cook according to the
situation.
It'll definetely take an hour,
Romas. For sure.
Maybe.
Or even more.
Okay, thanks for filming!
Our cooked zeppelins are done.
They have been cooking for about
1 hour 10 minutes.
We'll take cooked zeppelins out

it.
I've cut it with a knife. Now
I'll try it.
So, taster, how's the tasty!
It's really rather good. As

They'll soon be ready.
We're turning the meat over

Mmm. It looks really nice.
We're adding some mayonnaise.
We had added 3 tablespoons.

Pepper.
And steak spices.
Cover both sides of the meat
with spices.
We had added some salt and
now we'll beat it.
We're heating the pan, pouring
some oil in.
The egg is beaten.
So, MO, tell us how to make
this meat?
Like this. Into the egg...
Both sides.
And then into the rusks.
It's not difficult at all.
And we're putting it into the
pan. How long until it's done?
It will fry very fast.
Because it's so thin.
It's thin, but if you tenderize
it well, little Romas...
It fries fast.
The chops are frying.
Here. It's done.
One side is fried. We have
just turned it over.
The chops are done, so we 're
adding some pototoes in.
But of course you can eat it
with whatever you like.
Mashed potatoes.
Rice. Whatever you want.
Chop to the plate.
Here you are, Mister.
Thank you!
You're welcome.
This is how it looks.
And now it's tasting time.
Is it soft?
Mh.
I see you had poured some
sauce on.
Yes, I had. Of course this sauce
is a personal liking. I...
"I like it, right?"
Yes, I like it with the sauce
sometimes.
It's really tasty chop! Thank
you, MO, for making it so tasty!
Okay, you are welcome!
So?
You'll be able to teach your
fiancé!
Okay, okay...
Hehehe.
Ammm... What would you like to
say to the viewers?
Nothing. Let you be healthy and
have a nice spring.
And have tasty...
Food...
Dinner.
Yes, tasty food.
Thank you, viewers, and
good-bye!
So, you had made for me. Now
you are making for others.
Yes, yes, the others will come
to eat.
Whole day is busy.
Yes, Romas. I'm...
All of you...
Hello, everyone, hello MO!
Hello!
On this episode a special
dish - garlic chicken.
What will we need for this
garlic chicken, MO?
Here we have chicken
thighs.
Mh.
And drumsticks.
Then garlic.
Butter.
Thy... Thyme.
Mixture of salt and pepper.
Aha, what do we have here?
Lemon, honey, heavy cream,
flour, wine and brown sugar
Mh. I would like to mention
that's white wine.
We're putting some salt and
pepper on top.
We inserted some butter to
the pan to melt.
It's very fast, MO. Let's
not rush.
We're putting the chicken to
the pan to fry.
We're putting some spices on
as we haven't added any yet
on this side.
We're turning the chicken over
and we'll fry the other side of 
the chicken.
The chicken fried a bit. We're
moving it to this glass pot.
We could keep it in the pan,
but there isn't enough space.
We fried each side for about
5 minutes. Roughly.
We will fry another chicken
batch now.
Our chicken is fried and put 
into the pot. There were about 
2 kilos of it.
We'll make sauce next.
This is how the chicken
looks.
We will use garlic cloves
for the sauce.
Here we have 50 bulbs,
Cloves.
Ah, okay. Cloves.
You wouldn't eat it with 50
bulbs of garlic in here.
Aha.
We are adding 1.5 tablespoon 
of honey.
We are adding 3 tablespoons
of brown sugar.
We are mixing everything well.
Now it's time for the wine.
And we're adding some
white wine.
That was 300 ml of white
wine.
We're adding some thyme.
About 3 sprigs.
We put all of your sauce on the
chicken
and we'll put it in the oven
to cook in 200 C [390 F] for
about
30-45 minutes.
We're boiling on the fire as 
boiling in the oven would take 
a very long time.
An we're putting the chicken
into the oven.
Here it is. Look how greatly
it boils, Romas.
Mmmmhhh.
Let's look at the time and
that's it.
Okay, we'll look.
This chicken is typically eaten
with mashed potatoes, so
that's why we're making it.
But... You can choose your
favourite garnish.
Yeees!
We are grating some lemon zest.
We will use it for our final
sauce.
We have around a tablespoon
of grated lemon zest here.
So, our chicken is almost ready.
It took about half an hour.
Oh.
We are taking the chicken.
It certainly looks beautiful.
Ahh... We will now move the 
chicken to the other plate.
Because we have to upgrade
our sauce.
We're covering the chicken, so 
it wouldn't get cold.
We are moving the sauce to the
pan.
We are putting 1.5 tablespoon
of flour.
We are putting about a 
tablespoon of lemon zest.
And about 4 tablespoons of
heavy cream.
We are mixing everything well.
We took it out as it would have
been hard to pour everything
out.
And we are pouring our upgraded
sauce.
And we will cook it for about
5 minutes more.
We have been boiling it for
about 2 minutes. There was
no need for more.
We will make mashed
potatoes now.
We are smashing the potatoes.
We a boiling the milk.
We poured the milk in.
And... we will smash it a bit
more.
We poured in boiling milk,
right?
Of course it was boiling.
We're putting some mashed
potatoes in.
And the chicken now.
Sauce on top, Romas?
On top.
Sauce on top, MO.
Ehh... We are squeezing some
lemon.
And we'll put some sauce
on.
Don't be spare on garlic and
everything, MO.
You won't get more than 5
cloves.
Heh.
You have counted everything,
right?
Maybe a should add a tomatoe,
Romas.
Mmmm... I don't know.
Separately on the plate.
We'll put it like that. So, it's
time to try it.
I'm others pieces and that's it.
Now it's time to try it.
Mmmhm.
Mh.
You did very well, MO!
Have you tried it yet?
You are very lucky.
Tasty!
Have you tried it yet?
Yes.
Mh. It's really tasty for sure.
What do think about it?
5 stars.
Heh.
Is it out of 5?
Yes.
Okay.
Thank you viewers for watching,
subscribing, likes, comments.
Thank you and bye!
MO?
Bye!
... from dinner.
I won't film more...
Hello, everyone! Heh.
Hello!
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello!
On this episode one of the most
important dishes in Lithuania - 
zeppelins.
I would like to say that each
chef prepare it a little
differently,
but we will show our recepe.
What will we need for it?
Grated potatoes are ready.
Mh.
Here we have boiled.Over there
we are waiting for potatoe 
starch to set.
Mh.
Salt.
Mh.
Here?
We have bacon pieces and onions 
for the sauce here.
Mh.
We will also make zeppelins
with curd.
We will put some "warm"
smoked bacon to the curd.
What do we have here?
It's meat.
Mh.
Chopped onions, peppers.
Mh.
Here?
Basil here.
Basil here, we will add some
salt and that's it.
We will first prepare the pieces
of bacon before the starch sets.
Prepare the meat.
Prepare the curd and we will
then form the zeppelins.
Cook our bacon pieces.
How much to fry them?
I think about 10 minutes, little
Romas.
Mh.
Are they done already?
Yes, they are. I will add some
onions now.
How many onions do you have
here? 1 onion, 2 onions?
Here?
3 onions.
Mh.
They are small.
How much bacon there was?
Maybe around 400 g of bacon.
Mix everythin and how much
time until it's done?
At least 2 minutes.
Bacon pieces are ready.
I will pour into this.
We are pouring into another...
Container and let it be.
We will mix meat now.
What will we take?
Onions. How much do we have 
here, MO?
1 kilo 200 grams, three onios.
Aha.
We poured onions.
We will add some pepper.
How much?
A good teaspoon for sure.
Mh.
I like basil a lot.
A couple spoons of basil.
Here.
Some salt.
How much?
As much as you can give.
Hmm.
If you make too salty, that's
your problem.
That's enough.
Mix everything well.
Give me that container.
Meat is mixed.
We moved it to another
container, because MO said
it was better for her.
Takes less space on the table.
We will prepare the curd now.
Everything... We put some
bacon, right?
Yes, yes, it was bacon and
we won't add any salt, because
is little bit salty.
Mh.
Mix everything.
How much curd there was here?
About?
Around 250 grams.
Potatoes and starch are here.
Potatoes are here. Both kind
of potaoes, right?
Yes, yes, raw and boiled.
We are also adding the starch.
How much of potatoes are
here?
All of them.
You see how there are.
How many in kilos roughly?
I don't know, little Romas. I
don't measure it, I do it "by
the eye".
And it's always great!
Yes, it's always great!
How much of the meat are here
you said?
1 kilo 200 grams.
We are adding some salt.
About a tablespoon or more?
Little more than that.
Mh.
Mangle.
Mangle everything.
The water is getting hotter.
We will wait until it's boiling,
right?
A full pot.
Won't we wait?
We will wait. Of course we will
wait.
Yes.
Until it's boiling.
Tell us how to form a zeppelin.
Look.
Take some.
Take some potatoes.
Yes. Tap it on your palm.
Mh.
Make a flat piece.
Put some meat inside.
Close the edges, right?
Yes.
Roll it between your hands like
that. What is this water for?
To wet my hands.
So they aren't so sticky, right?
You should also cover baking
tray with water.
Ah.
This is also covered with water,
so they don't stick.
Mh.
Look.
How many do you think you'll
make today?
In total?
I think probably 40.
What are we doing, MO?
MOving water to another pot.
Why so?
Because we will prepare
zeppelins with curd separately.
Here with meat, there with meat.
Yes, yes, Mister.
Put some salt.
Full this big spoon.
Nnn.
Okay, it wasn't full.
If you put full... We will put 
some starch, so the zeppelins
are not rough on the outside.
We are adding some starch.
Not much at all.
There was about one teaspoon
of starch.
So they are not rough on the
outside.
Will you add there as well?
Yes, I will, Romas.
Mh.
Water is not boilling yet.
We will also add there.
We won't show that. You need
to add there as well.
Put this zeppelin for a swim. 
To boil, not to "swim".
How long will they have to swim?
Until they are boiled.
How long roughly?
20 minutes, probably maybe more,
Romas.
Mh.
We will now make zeppelins with
curd now.
Yes.
So... The way of making is the
same.
Do that...
Curd filling.
Put curd instead of meat.
As I can see. You are making
them round and not oval to
differentiate easier, right?
Yes.
Because.
Because what?
Even if you make them
separately.
This is how they are made
according to the recipe.
Round.
Mh.
Look at these doughnuts.
Some of these zeppelins are
boiling for about 5 minutes.
Oh come on...
What?
It has just started, little 
Romas.
Okay, it has just started.
We will add more now, so they 
won't stick to each other.
Here are our boiling...
Zepps.
...zepps.
Over there with curd.
Meat here, curd here.
Zeppelins are ready. We will now
add to the plate.
We will first turn off the heat,
so they don't get soft.
Okay.
How many for you?
2.
One with meat, one with curd?
No.
With meat? Won't you taste with
curd?
Uh-uh.
When will taste with curd?
I know that those with curd are
tasty.
I prefer with... Meat. Those
with curd are equally tasty.
2 at first and then we will see.
We are putting some bacon
pieces on.
I will be generous for you.
Okay.
Here you, Mister.
Mh.
And some sour cream.
Maybe next to it, Romas?
On top.
Okay, thank you.
I also like eating zeppelins
with milk, but it's up to
everyone.
I will taste  now. I have tasted
many times,
So I know what I will get, but I
will say it again.
Mhm,,.
Excellent taste, MO.
It's very good that it's 
excellent.
You certainly know how to make 
zeppelins. You must have
made 10000 in you lifetime.
That's for sure, Romas!
Even more than that.
Probably more.
Thank you, MO for making them.
You are welcome.
I hope that you will make
plenty of times more.
Yes, yes.
Goodbye, viewers!
Bye!
Let's go eat some zeppelins!
Let's go!
... will make zeppelins.
I see you have something nice
on yourself.
Explain...
Yes!
where you got it from.
My client came back from
"Kaziukas" fair and brought me.
What?
Ring-shape rolls.
Turn around and show what it
is.
Here, look!
So beautiful!
Good morning! Hello, MO!
Good morning!
What happened to you that you
are waking me up at 4 am.?
Explain yourself!
I allowed you to sleep some
more.
Okay.
It's an early moring now.
Yeah, early. What will we make
now?
I decided to make pork roll-ups
in the brackets "Zrazy".
Mh. So, how? What will we need?
I see pork which we don't have
yet.
No, we don't, but I'll run to
the shop later.
Aha.
Here?
4 finely chopped onions, 
Mh.
Oil to fry onions and here we
have some mushrooms.
Dried boiled mushrooms and
some all kinds of pickled 
mushrooms.
As I can see pepper.
Pepper. We'll put some salt to
the filling.
Our onions are frying. We're
adding some oil... Not much.
Onions have fried a bit. We're
adding some mushrooms now.
How long will we fry them more?
5 minutes and everything will be
done.
We're adding some pepper.
And some salt, so now we
mixing everything well.
MIx everything well. It will
heat up and will be done.
For the sauce.
It's an important thing to
mention. 
Do it...
When we were boiling dried
mushrooms, we had some liquid
left 
which we will use for the sauce,
right?
For the sauce.
Don't throw away this liquid.
The mushrooms are ready, so
we'll put them...
We'l put them to cool off.
It's easier to form from cold
ones.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Cold when the are cold.
Hello, everyone, again.
We have some meat now. What
else will need to make them?
Ammmm,,,
First of all, salt.
Okay, some salt.
Salt, salt. Some spices for
minced meat.
Mh.
Pepper.
Aha.
We'll put 2 eggs.
2 eggs and I see some heavy
cream.
Heavy cream. We'll see how the
meat forms. If it is bruce,
we'll add and we might not put.
Mh.
We're adding 2 eggs.
How much meat did you have,
MO?
1.3 kg [2.9 lb.]
Mh.
We're adding some pepper.
And some meat spices.
They are for minced meat.
It's needed rather lot spices.
Of course.
And some salt.
I won't put much salt, because
there are some in there.
That will be enough.
Mh.
Mix everything well.
We'll add little bit of heavy
cream.
It will be...
What?
I think it will be coarse and
won't form. Heheh.
Mh.
Hehe.
The meat is mangled.
How to make them, MO?
First of all, we'll make balls
like this.
Heh.
Ah... Meatballs, right?
Yes, it's easier for me to make
like this.
Pou... Pour some oil on the
baking tray.
And rub it with a hand like
this.
I'll show you how to make.
Because we have been talking
and that's what we have.
Okay.
Take some meat. Make a patty.
To form a patty.
Mh.
Here.
Add some mushroom filling.
Mh.
In a way they are zeppelins.
Zeppelins only from meat.
Mh.
With mushrooms.
And then you roll them.
How many did you make, MO?
I have counted them already.
How many?
I think 13.
Heh.
Yeesssssssss...
You said it correctly.
Now we'll put them to cook.
How long will they take to
cook?
Probably around half an hour, 
Romas. They have to warm up.
The oven is preheated, right?
Yes.
We'll take them out now.
So nice! They look beautiful!
They cooked nicely, yes.
There some fat here. Can you
see?
It's okay.
We'll make the sauce from
that fat.
We're putting them into the pot.
And then what? Will you pour
over them?
We'll make the sauce, little
Romas.
We'll pour it over and keep it
in that sauce for a few minutes.
Zrazy are in the pot.
We're pouring the fats to
the pot.
And we're adding some flour.
How much will we add?
A large tablespoon will
be enough for this sauce.
Mix everything very well.
We'll boil it a bit, little
Romas.
Will you add anything else? 
Yes, of course we'll put. We
add mushroom liquid from
yesterday.
We're adding some water.
We're pouring mushroom
liquid.
It will be a real mushroom
sauce.
It'll add flavour and smell.
Yes, yes.
Let it heat up now. We'll
add some salt.
And we're adding some salt.
How long will they boil?
You know...
Until they boil? Until they
boil?
Until it boils and thickens.
We're adding some sour cream
to the sauce.
How many tablespoons will
you add? A couple?
A couple of tablespoons will be
enough for sure.
Aha, we're mixing everything
well.
We'll mix and we'll heat it
up until the sour cream melts.
We'll add some
peppercorns and bay leaves.
Mh.
Not muxh at all.
We're adding the sauce now.
It will stew for 5 minutes...
And...
4-5 minutes and they will
be ready.
Mh.
Zrazy. Potatoes are boiling for
a garnish.
So, our dish is ready.
The potaoes are finishing
boiling.

So, we're adding some potaoes.
We'll eat them with cabbages and

Yes..."piece of meat"... I'd

forehead.
Okay, some dills.
Cucumber?
Mh.
Put it in.
Kotlet - zrazy.
I'll wait for it to cool off.
And we'll eat.
Mh.

My mushrooming wasn't
for nothing.
It wasn't for nothing.
Hehehe.
What will you say to the

Tasty dinner. To make food
delicious!
And a nice spring.
Yes.
Spring.
So, thank you viewers for

Mix everything well.
The batter is mangled.
Onions. Don't save on onions
here.
Mh.
It's where all the taste comes
from. We'll add some pepper.
We're adding some peppers.

Okay, take some potatoes.
And? We're adding... the meat.
Meat. We'll add some meat.
Mh.
And we're packing everything.
"Pickle", yeah?
I said "packing". So, what?
We roll it. Oh, such a nice
quality.
Here.
Here.
Why do we have to put to starch?
Wait a bit more, because my
hands are sticky, I have to make
more.
Ahh...
We take a zeppelin and roll
it in starch.
What's next?
We'll put them to the plate. And
wait for the water to boil and
we'll boil them.
And we're putting it here.
The zeppelins are ready. We're
are waiting for the water to
boil and we'll add them.
The water is boiling. We're
adding some salt.
And we'll put zeppelins to boil.
How long will they boil about?
It will be fast.
So, how long?
4-5 minutes and that's it.
We won't add all of them at
once.
Mh.
Because we don't have all of
our clients here.
We're making a sauce. We've
put some butter in.
We've added some flour.
Not much, Romas.
A teaspoon. I mean a
tablespoon. And we're mixing
everything well.
We're adding some water.
Here.
The zeppelins are boiling.
We'll boil them for about
a couple of minutes more.
We're adding 2 tablespoons of
sour cream.
We're are mixing everything
well.
We'll add some salt and the
sauce will be ready.
And some salt here...
Okay, okay. And some salt.
The zeppelins are ready. We'll
put them here.
They have been boiling for not
so short. I think around 10
minutes.
Oh, come on!
I haven't been counting, but
it seemed long for me.
5 minutes for sure, Romas.
We're adding some sauce.
So, I will try it now.
Mh.
Excellent!
So, what will tell, MO?
I won't tell you anything. Eat
it before it gets cold.
It' won't get cold. Okay then.
Thank you viewers for watching.
There are half a hundred of
subscribers now.
So, the view numbers are
increasing for sure. It's great
to see that you are interested in
MO's kitchen.
So, thank you and bye!
Bye!
How many have you had already,
MO?
I'm eating my seeeeeeeecond,
Romas!
Will there be a third one?
No, there won't be, no.
But they are tasty, right?
For sure!
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello, hello!
Tell us what are we making
on this episode?
We will be making Potato Horns.
Mh. And what will we need to
make them?
Boiled potatoes.
Mh.
Eggs.
Mh.
Salt.
Mh.
Pepper.
Mh.
Some starch to put into the
potatoes.
Okay.
Into the meat...
Salt, pepper and fried onions.
Mh.
That's it, Romas.
We're cracking 2 eggs in.
We're adding some salt.
We're adding some salt to the
meat.
I won't be adding a lot of it to
the meat.
Mh.
Some... Starch here...
We're adding some starch. How
much are you adding?
I think about 3 tablespoons...
Mangle...
We're mixing everything well.
We'll see if it is a quality
product.
You know how they say... If
a dog doesn't it eat it...
Come on...
Mm... Terra.
You see. A quality product.
Hehehehehe.
We won't save on onions.
How much of them do we
have here?
Here we have 3 large onions.
Are there 3 large onions here?
Yes, Romas. The meat will be
tastier.
It doesn't look that much here.
They shrink.
Okay... We're adding some...
Ahh. Pepper.
I won't be adding any salt.
And mix everything well.
Here we have boiled chicken.
We had poured the oil in and
we'll heat it up now.
We poured some oil in, so
they...
Our horns wouldn't stick to
the surface.
That's it. Let's make them.
So tell us how to make them?
Take a ball, insert some meat
inside, roll it and make it.
The making of them is similar
to zeppelins, right?
Yes.
But they are smaller, right?
I'll make them straight, because
this is how you can fit more in.
Okay.
The oil has heated up. We're
putting them in to deep fry.
Is that a lonely horn? Is it for
tryting?
I wanted to check if my oil is
boiling.
Maybe I won't add more, Romas.
We'll see.
Okay. How long before they are
ready?
Until they are yellow. I don't
know how it will take.
Our... How are they called?
Potato horns.
Potato horns, but they have to
fry more.
Yes, we'll fry them more.
The horns are ready!
We'll put them in and eat. What
are they usually eaten with, MO?
With oil... Whoops...
With butter or sour cream.
I'll probably eat it with
butter. I want to see what will
happen.
Come on, Romas. It'll be really
fat... It won't be good.
Just a little bit then.
The best way, children...
What is it?
I liked the most with mushroom
sauce. Do you remember, mum?
Ah...
None of us would eat it mushroom
sauce. Put them in and eat, 
Romas. I'm making others.
Mh.
Jolanta, you must have eaten
these horns at...
I know. In the pie.
Yes. There weren't such horns

Yes, you did.
Ah. I wanted to say "with
butter"... Yeah...
This is how it look with butter.
A quality product.
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello!
On this episode we're making.

sauce.
Also known as Shogayaki chops.
What will we need to make them?
Pork sirloin.
Mh.
Garlic.
Yes.
Grated onion.

What do we have here?
Tomatoes.
Mh.
Fresh cabbage.
Mh.
Soy sauce.
Mh.
Wine.
Oil.
Mh.
Apple juice.
Mh.
Flour.
Yes.
Sugar.
Sugar.
[You can add more liquid,
because we didn't have enough
of liquidy part.]
We're adding some wine. You 
should use mirin, but we don't
have it, so we're using simple
wihite wine.
Add as many spoons of wine
as you're making chops.
We're making 7 chops, so we
are adding 7 tablespoons of
wine.
Add half teaspoon of ginger for
1... No add 1/4 teaspoon of
ginger for 1 chop.
Then we're adding grated onion.
1 chop needs half teaspoon of
onion.
I mean half tablespoon of onion.
1 tablespoon of soy sauce for
1 chop.
We'll also boil some potatoes
for the chops, but you can eat
it with whatever you like.
It's not usual to eat this chop
with potatoes.
We're adding grated garlic.
1/8 of teaspoon is required
for 1 chop.
Mix everything well.
We're adding some apple juice.
1 tablespoon for 1 chop.
We're adding some sugar.
So... Ahh... 1 chop needs about
1/4 teaspoon of sugar.
So, we're added about 1
tablespoon.
Not a full spoon.
Mh.
The sauce is boiling, so we're
just moving it to the side.
We're adding some flour here.
We're preparing the chop here.
We're cutting the sides, so they
wouldn't curl when cooking.
So they wouldn't get smaller
and curl.
A few cuts on each side.
We're adding some oil to the
pan.
Take a chop and cover it in
flour.
Do you know me? Do you know me?
Do you know me?
And we're putting them to fry.
[Both sides are fried.]
Okay, the chops are fried.
Now...
We'll put the lid on and fry
them on the low heat for
about a couple of minutes.
So, we'll fry them them on the
low heat for a couple of
minutes.
We've poured some of the liquid
out of the pan and...
We're turning the heat off.
Don't turn it off. We'll make
the sauce.
Yes, we're turning it off then
will heat again.
We're turning the heat off
and add some sauce.
We're adding the sauce now.
2 teaspoons for...
Ah... 1 chop. I hope we'll have
enough.
Okay, we're adding teh sauce.
We didn't have enough sauce,
so we're adding some more, so
it's a bit more liquidy.
[We've added less spices and
more liquids.]
So, when can we?
Okay, we're adding the starch.
Maybe we shouldn't add all
of it.
We should add all of it, little
Romas.
You think? Okay.
There're some liquid here.
The meat... The sauce has just
started boiling, so that's 
enough frying.
Here we have a typical garnish
for this Shogayaki chop.
That's some cabbage and a
tomato.
We're adding the chop.
When she leaves...
The sauce has thickened.
Here you are, Mister!
Thank you!
...
I'll try this Japanese chop now.
Mmm.
Excellent!
Terra...
...
So, MO. It's good chop.
Tasty?
Mh.
Good then.
We'll make for Easter.
Of course we made a mistake
that we made too little of the
liquid, but generally...
Very tasty chop.
Yes.
Thank you for watching and bye!
Bye!
How do like this Japanese
Shogayaki chop?
Very tasty!
Mh.
What else will you tell?
Nothing.
What can we all learn from our
mistake? That you should make
more sauce, right?
Yes, yes, Romas. You have to
make a little more.
Mh.
You pressed it, didn't you? Okay... So, MO,
you'll try virtual reality now. Put it on.
Put them on for me.
Okay.
Hah...
Ah... Maybe or head is a bit...
Larger.
Have you ever been in virtual reality, MO?
Not a single time in my life.
You have only been in real life, haven't you?
Yes.
Everything what's real... And now you'll
see what's not real... Here. Like this.
Do you see something already?
I see the mountains.
Move the headset, if you need,
I see some...
Okay. There is...
Put it on correctly. Is comfortable for you now or not?
Stonegghh...
A stone? Okay, look. Eh...This is twisted a bit.
Look. Is it comfortable for you or not?
Yes, it's comfortable, Romas. Jesu... Blue
mountains.
So. Okay. Take the controllers.
Ohh... Romas, I'm falling...
Hahahaha... No, no. Don't be afraid. Okay. Wait.
Put the hand in front of me. Put it in.
To the bottomeless pit...
Here. Hold it with your hand. Okay.
Put the over hand in now. Here. We'll press
for you, if needed, you know. If you don't, that's
okay.
Arghhh...
Oh, Jesus, I cannot look to that side. There's
a huge pit over there.
Okay. Take them confortably as you did with the other one.
Here. Look. Ah...
To the bottom.
Like this. Okay. Now...
Look at that pit. You can film a bit over there, Saul,
what she is seeing.
Oh...
Romas, it's a real pit...
Look at it.
MO is even moving back. It shows up that the virtual reality
A real pit... That's the edge. And there is a pit over there.
Look at it....Oh come... Jesus, Jesus. Something steep
over there and again a pit.
MO. Okay, now we'll...
Which one makes to go forward, Saul? Ahh...
Here...
Okay. We'll try. You have travelled somethere.
Here. Wait... Here.
You can teleport. I'll press for you. Here.
Yes...
Okay. Now look at that side. Here! Look at the edge of it.
Yes. Haha...
Aren't you afraid? Maybe we could go lower? No...
We cant'
Yes, Romas. Ah...You can fall of the cliff!
Yes, you can!
Yes...
Wait... Ah. I have come from over there. Okay.
We'll go to the highest point, if we can. Okay.
Look!
Yes, yes.
Look down.
Oh... That edge. Oh...
Look at that.
It's scary, Romas!
Here!
Stop it, Romas!
Wait. Hold it.
Romas!
Look over there...
So, MO?
Stop it, Okay? You are stupid!
You'll fall, right?
Yes?
Okay, let's see. Maybe we'll...
The cliff and you can fall.
Okay, let's see maybe we can get higher.
Down.
Wait. Let's see if we can get higher.
You'll fall too. You'll see...
I am without the headset, I won't fall.
Arggg... I see... That's probably the highest spot.
Let's see. We can get to the other place.
Here.
That's ome nature! We can get to this...
You want to go to the edge?
Yes.
Yes, look at this.
Look around at the mountains. Have you ever been to
the mountains, MO?
I have never, except for Romainiai hill.
Hehehe.
We forgot to put the headphones on. Are there
any music?
I don't need no headphones, Romas
Here it is. I'll put it on one ear. Are they comfortable
for you?
Mhm...
Okay.
Look at that... Something's moving here. Some sort of...
Do you hear the sound?
No. Some kind of creature is moving here.
That's a creature.
Yes. Here. Hehehe.
It's a new breed.
How do you like virtual reality so far, MO?
It's very beautiful! I was afraid to move, Romas, at that edge!
A pit over here again, you cannot go anywhere.
Come on...
You see? And you going there. Don't go too
far away.
Hehehe.
Let's see where we can go now. Turn around. Okay...
It's deep here again.
Where can we go now? Look here.
Do you see these mountains?
Yes, yeah.
Oh, Jesus! There's a huge mountain over there
as well.
Mhm...
Over there as well.
Oh. There's some sort of hole over there as well.
Mhm...
Oh come on. Take off these glasses or I will get
crazy or I'll fall to this pit.
Okay, we'll try something else on you. Okay...
...
Now we have travelled to the meadows...
What is there in the sky? A helicopter? No, a bird of some
sort.
Yes, a bird.
Yesh.
One bird is singing to me in the ear.
Now you can hear it, right?
Mh, mh.
Here...
Okay, let's try to go somewhere. Okay, let's go over there.
Here.
Okay, let's move. You can look at it from the diffrent
place. Another bird, look.
One, two, threee! Here...
More, than that, MO.
This.
Be careful. Turn around, so you wouldn't step on the cable.
The creature is running.
I'll hold them, so they wouldn't brake.
The stones are large here.
Oh... I'm afraid to go anywhere, because you can
get stuck somewhere.
You won't get stuck don't be afraid.
Here.
Hehehe.
How is it, MO?
It's great!
Have you ever been to places like this in the world, MO?
Yes, I have today.
Heh.
Have you seen anu difference between. Am...
Virtual reality what you are seeing right now and what
you see in real life? The mountains, trees. Is the image
different to you in any way?
Romas, it's like this in other countries, isn't it?
Yes, but do you see any difference? Maybe it looks
worse or is it the same?
It looks the same.
It's the same, Romas.
Yes.
It looks as it was real.
It look as if you were here in this place, right?
Yes, yes!
For sure!
Okay, we'll try to show you something more.
Everythings moving!
Don't be afraid, MO. It'll be very very scary! Have you ever
been to the amuzement part?
Oh, Romas, I will fall.
I'm holding you. Don't be afraid.
Oh...
Can hear the sound?
It has blacked out.
Ah... Wait. Maybe it's covering.
It's okay now.
What can it be?
The letters are here. It's okay now.
I might have covered the sensors.
Oh come on...
Don't be afraid, MO!
Ugh-ugh-ugh....
We might need to catch her.
I'm not going anywhere.
You'll see what happens now.
It'll come...
The end wil come to me.
You're going up the carousell, you'll be going down
soon.
The grey pipe is going.
Everything is going up, up, up!
Agh...
We'll see how you do, MO.
As I said, you can stay at one place. You can move your
head. You'll see how high you are.
Oh, Romas, it's so beautiful here! So green!
Go...
Look, how high you are.
Oh, Jesus!
Hah.
I'm afraid to think what will happen now.
Agh.
Agh...
If it gets too scary, just close your eyes, but try not to,
because it won't be intresting. Look over there. You'll
soon be getting down.
Maybe you'll stop here, if I'm not mistaken or maybe
not.
Agh...
Here.
So?
The legs are moving, go poo, children!
Look at this!
Aghhh!
Ahhhh!
Oh, Romas, there's a red bottomless pit over there!
Go...
I'm holding you, don't be afraid!
If it gets too scary, just close your eyes, okay?
Look. Phew...
Oh, Jesus, Jesus! It'only for you watch, not for anyone else.
Go...
Wait, wait. As I said you can close your eyes, if it gets too
scary, okay?
Did you close your eyes?
Mhm. I cannot be here...
Is it too scary?
Mhhh...
Open your eyes for a bit.
Open your eyes.
Come on...
Open your eyes.
I can't look anywhere!
Open your eyes, open your eyes...
Open your eyes, MO!
I can't move my eyes up or down!
Is it too scary?
Come on...
Heh.
Ughhhhhhh...
That's it, you can open your eys now.
That's enough for me already!
You can open your eyes now.
Let me go of this music and everything.
You can open your eyes, there will be nothing else.
What do you mean "there will be nothing else"?
Open your eyes!
Everything is still moving her!
Hah...
Everything's going up, up!
That's it. You have finished it.
Ohhhhh...
Was it scary?
I am burning now! My whole body is burning!
Heh...
I'm all sweaty now!
That's enough!
Okay!
That's enough of torturing me! 
Was it fun?
Come on!
It's fun, but you know... Purrrppp...
Wait a bit, I'll help soon, MO.
Oh, Jesus, Jesus!
I'll take this off as well.
Nobody could fully watch this, children.
They would. So, MO, tell us about your impressions.
Go...
What do you think for sure?
Say it.
I was afraid to fall off.
But was it fun?
I probably wouldn't play games likes these. 
Too scary?
It's very scary for me.
What about the places in the mountains?
It's scary as well, Romas.
But you can manage it.
Yes.
This one is too...
This one here, here, here, here... Is... I don't want
it...
Heh.
Very scary.
Yes, it's very scary...
Mhm...
You can stand and look around in the mountains.
You can.
Mhm.
And here, Romas...
But you liked it?
Yes, I liked it.
Okay.
Can we travel again?
Ughh...
Hehe...
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Good evening! Late evening. We
will marinate meat this evening.
Mh.
We will marinate the to make
a simple marinated pork chop.
What will we need to make it?
Here. Simple pork chops with
a bone.
That's some quality! Yes.
Yes.
Rosemary.
Mh.
Peppers.
Yes.
Garlic.
Mh.
Turmeric.
Mh.
Red paprika powder.
Mh.
Sa...lt.
Mh.
Brown sugar.
Mh.
Water and olive oil.
...here.
This is my crushed salt.
Of course you don't have
to use crushed salt... I just
wanted to try it
to play with this apparatus.
We are adding one tablespoon
of salt.
Maybe I'll add a bit more,
Romce.
Just a little bit.
Okay.
We are putting the water in.
A litre of water. It will 
definetely cover meat.
Mh.
That will definetely be enough.
Yes.
Here.
We will melt the salt now.
A teaspoon of peppercorns.
It's also the same in sense
that I want to...
Here, crush them.
I really want to crush them.
Don't crush everything. I want
to try too.
No need to use so much
strength. Lightly.
Can you see how qualitatively?
Mh.
Okay.
Let me.
The peppers are crushed. We
are putting them in. Here we 
have a teaspoon of them.
We're putting a tablespoon
of rosemary.
If you want you can use
sprigs, but we don't have
any.
Dried will be fine, Romas.
Yes, it wouldn't be worse.
We're mixing everything.
We're cutting the garlic at the
right angle
ehhh... to the clove of garlic.
And we are putting everything
like that.
It's unusual, but it has to be
like that.
With all skins,
Yes.
Ohh!
With everything.
We will put two garlic bulbs.
This is how our marinate looks
like.
Such a nice smell, right, MO?
Yes, yes. Smells of rosemary.
And garlic and pepper, you can
feel everything.
Okay, we are putting the meat
in now.
Add as much water, so they
are under the water.
If we don't have enough water,
we'll add some more.
That's enough.
Precisely. Calculated perfectly.
M-hm.
Now we will wait. It's an
evening now, tomorrow
at dinner...
We're putting it into the
fridge.
This is how our marinated
chops look like.
MO is taking some of the herbs
off as there wouldn't be that 
much.
Of course it's much easier to
use sprigs as you don't need
to take them off of every chop.
It is what it is.
The process of the drying.
Press on it to dry it.
We'll make sauce now. We will
need a teaspoon of turmeric for
1 chop.
1 teaspoon of sweet red paprika
for 1 chop.
A tablespoon of brown sugar
for 1 chop.
And 1.5 tablespoon of...
That will be 4.5 tablespoons?
Mh.
1.5 tablespoon for 1 chop.
Not lilac but, olive oil heh.
Mix everything well.
The sauce is mixed.
We're taking dry chops and
cut the edges.
So the sauce get easier in.
We're cutting the other side
as well.
We are taking a utensil and
covering the chop. Both sides
of course.
This is how covered chops
look like. I can't wait to try 
them.
It's time to marinate them a
bit... About. Half an hour, hour
or a bit more.
But an... Ehhh.. Hour will
be fine.
How qualitatively they
marinated.
We'll add some oil to the
pan.
The oil is hot, not it's time
for the chops to fry.
Will there be enough space
for all?
We'll put them, so they fit.
Yes.
It looks nice!
The most important is that
they would be tasty.
They say "You won't live with
beauty".
Yes.
If they don't have any brains,
then the beauty is useless.
Maybe it'll be the same with
chops.
Yes.
I think they will be not only
beautiful, but also tasty.
It's cooking. What do think, MO?
Will it be tasty?
It will be very tasty!
Mh.
Ohh! Such... Perfect... How
beautiful it looks.
I even lost the words..
Lost to the pan.
We're turning them over. It
looks beautiful.
Here we have... How to say.
Some fried sugar. Caramelized
sugar.
Evrything has to be like that.
They will be tree Xs pork chops,
MO.
You won't eat them.
Looks nice!
Here we pour some sauce
on, so it would divide evenly.
Here.
This on will be for you.
It looks so beautiful!
The pork chops are finished.
We've been frying them for
about 15 minutes, maybe a
bit longer.
Put this quality pork chop for
me.
Not small.
Not small, just like you.
And we are putting... I want
one potatoe.
And we're adding.
A half potatoe for you!
Okay, that's enough, I want
to eat some meat normally. 
Normally.
Mh.
You're a meat eater.
Okay, here is how it looks!
So?
This is how the meat looks
at close.
This is how it looks. Everything
is cooked.
Now of course. To try it.
Mh-hm.
Cut some for me!
So tasty, MO!
Cut some for me to try it!
I will, I will. It's only...
Heh. Ehhh...It's very tasty.
Unexp... Unexpected taste.
I haven't tried such thing.
Ehh... For sure. After you 
taste, you'll be amazed. Here.
Cut and try.
The meat is cooked perfectly.
It's all white.
Yes.
So, how is it?
It's really tasty for sure.
Tasty!
Yes!
Mh-mh.
Thank you viewers for watching.
It's nice to see that there are 
more fans.
There are more than half a
hundred.
Thank you and until next time!
Bye!
Good-bye!
Here I have a real dessert
a bone everything that's
the best,
For your dog.
No, it's for me. That's left
will be for the dog.
I have here the highest quality
product left here.
Heh.
Will you bite the bone?
Yes.
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello, hello!
Tell us what are we making
on this episode?
We will be making Potato Horns.
Mh. And what will we need to
make them?
Boiled potatoes.
Mh.
Eggs.
Mh.
Salt.
Mh.
Pepper.
Mh.
Some starch to put into the
potatoes.
Okay.
Into the meat...
Salt, pepper and fried onions.
Mh.
That's it, Romas.
We're cracking 2 eggs in.
We're adding some salt.
We're adding some salt to the
meat.
I won't be adding a lot of it to
the meat.
Mh.
Some... Starch here...
We're adding some starch. How
much are you adding?
I think about 3 tablespoons...
Mangle...
We're mixing everything well.
We'll see if it is a quality
product.
You know how they say... If
a dog doesn't it eat it...
Come on...
Mm... Terra.
You see. A quality product.
Hehehehehe.
We won't save on onions.
How much of them do we
have here?
Here we have 3 large onions.
Are there 3 large onions here?
Yes, Romas. The meat will be
tastier.
It doesn't look that much here.
They shrink.
Okay... We're adding some...
Ahh. Pepper.
I won't be adding any salt.
And mix everything well.
Here we have boiled chicken.
We had poured the oil in and
we'll heat it up now.
We poured some oil in, so
they...
Our horns wouldn't stick to
the surface.
That's it. Let's make them.
So tell us how to make them?
Take a ball, insert some meat
inside, roll it and make it.
The making of them is similar
to zeppelins, right?
Yes.
But they are smaller, right?
I'll make them straight, because
this is how you can fit more in.
Okay.
The oil has heated up. We're
putting them in to deep fry.
Is that a lonely horn? Is it for
tryting?
I wanted to check if my oil is
boiling.
Maybe I won't add more, Romas.
We'll see.
Okay. How long before they are
ready?
Until they are yellow. I don't
know how it will take.
Our... How are they called?
Potato horns.
Potato horns, but they have to
fry more.
Yes, we'll fry them more.
The horns are ready!
We'll put them in and eat. What
are they usually eaten with, MO?
With oil... Whoops...
With butter or sour cream.
I'll probably eat it with
butter. I want to see what will
happen.
Come on, Romas. It'll be really
fat... It won't be good.
Just a little bit then.
The best way, children...
What is it?
I liked the most with mushroom
sauce. Do you remember, mum?
Ah...
None of us would eat it mushroom
sauce. Put them in and eat, 
Romas. I'm making others.
Mh.
Jolanta, you must have eaten
these horns at...
I know. In the pie.
Yes. There weren't such horns
at our work.
... So...
No there were mushroom sauce.
I'm eating the first time or the
first time I remember and it's
really tasty.
So, thank you, MO, for...
You are welcome that you wanted
such dishes.
What would you like to say to
the viewers? Give me a
moment to decrease the...
To make chicken horns...
Not only watch, but also make
it, right?
Yes.
Write a comment what you
managed to do successfully
and what unsuccessfully.
... Yes.
Thank you, viewers, for watching
and until next time! Bye!
Bye!
This is how it looks with oil...
With butter.
Ah... I'm telling nonsense.
This is how it looks with oil...
Oh my God... He poured some oil
on top...
Did I say "oil" again?
Yes, you did.
Ah. I wanted to say "with
butter"... Yeah...
This is how it look with butter.
A quality product.
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!

episode, MO?

We're tenderizing the meat.
One side is enough.
Yes.
Unfold the plaque.
The plaque. It's cellophane

Mmm.
Okay, cellophane.

I need to put my glasses on,

Yes. We're putting the glasses

Aaand what now?
We'll put some apricots in

Mh.
What's for your trouble!
Oh, thank you!
Okay and we roll.
There should some
apricots in the center.
Here.
Here look. What pot
will I need?
Look at this sausage!
Hehehe. Yes. It will be smaller
after boiling.
What else is there to do?
Tie it.
The ends have to be tied up,
right?
We'll tie both ends, Romas.
Yes, yes.
Two ends.
Tie them hard.
And of course we tie the 
other end.
Explain, MO, how to tie like
this.
This is how it's needed.
So it doesn't unfold.
But it's not clear how to
do like this.
You have to graduate from
the university.
Maybe it's needed.
You can cut off the ends.
And also cellophane ends.
Oh.
Let me. It's high quality thing!
It's like one piece. You wouldn't
notice there are few pieces of
meat.
So, we will cook...
"Boil". We will boil tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
It will marinate overnight.
Mh.
We're putting it in a cold
place.
Mh.
So, hello!
Hello!
Here we have some water being
heated. Here we have a roll-up.
[Put it between the walls].
We're putting it into cold
water to boil.
What spices will we need?
Here we have some leaves.
Aha.
Some. Allspice and pepper.
Some vegeta spice mix.
Mh.
To put in.
How long do we boil this
roll-up?
About 50 minutes.
Mh.
From putting it in, right?
No, after it starts boiling.
Ah, then it starts boiling.
...
Some salt.
I think that will be enough.
And a tablespoon of salt [less
than that].
Some herbs left from
yesterday.
Mh.
I'll add some water, so the
roll-up is fully submerged.
We're adding some water,
so it is fully submerged.
So, that's it.
We'll wait until it's boiling.
The water reach boiling
point.
And it's boiling.
We'll boil it for about 50
minutes.
[The files of taking the roll-up
out of the water were corrupted
while transferring them to a PC.
Like this.
Cut this roll-up.
I will cut it.
So, we are cutting the the rope,
right?
We'll cut the rope... Wait
a little, Romas.
You'll pour some water out,
right?
I'll pour some of the water out.
Here.
That's it. It will be shorter.
And it will be straight again.
So, you're retying.
Yes, I will tie this end.
Because it has shrunk, right?
Yes, how could it not shrunk?
What will we do now?
We'll put it under some
weights. We'll take it to the
balcony. The sun is not shining.
Mh.
And it will be there until the
evening. Around 9 pm. or so.
It'll be cool and we'll put it
into the fridge. And everything
will be done.
Yes.
We'll put a board like this on
it.
Mh.
We'll put a bucket of water
on top, so it won't fall. Not
full bucket.
Mh.
No need for a full one.
Put something on the sides, so
it doesn't fall.
Mh. So, you can hold the sides
like this, so it doesn't...
So it won't hold on one roll-up.
Yeah.
Then there are two you can
put something without
anything by the sides.
So, MO brought the roll-up!
We'll have breakfast, right?
Yes.
So, show us how to cut it
and everything.
God, God... Don't you know how
to cut a roll-up?
It's high quality stuff, right, MO?
Yes. It pressed down nicely.
So?
Cut it, cut it...
Put it, put it, No sign of
apricot there yet.
Oh, here it is.
[The real apricot ;D] Here.
Here how beautiful it looks.
Tetete.
And now it's time to try
it of course.
The roll-up is really good.
Thank you, MO, for making
it.
Thank you [you are welcome].
We'll make for Easterm right?
Yes, we'll be able to 
celebrate Easter properly
with this roll-up.
Okay.
Thank you for watching, viewers!
There are more and more views!
Take it, Terra!
High quality stuff, right, MO?
Yes!
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello!
What wll we make on this
episode, MO?
You tell what we'll make.
Okay. We'll make slowly cooked
pork side with honey and soy 
sauce.
What is it needed to make it?
First of all, the most important
thing.
Pork side.
Yes.
Spring onions.
Mh.
Potatoes.
Potatoes.
Garlic, salt, sugar.
Mh.
Brown sugar, 
Mh.
Soy sauce.
Olive oil, honey, 
Mh.
And?
Beans.
Here we have around 90 ml
[3 oz.] of sugar.
We are pouring it in.
We're adding 4 tea... tablespoons
of...
Ahh... Chopped garlic.
We're cutting some onions.
Spring onions is that how they
are called, right?
Yes, yes.
Here we have some...  chopped
spring onions. We're putting
everything in.
We're pouring around 300 ml
[10.1 fl. oz.] of soy sauce.
Here we have 250 ml 
[8.5 fl. oz.], so we'll add more
later.
The sauce, I mean the marinate
is mixed.
Explain what should we do now.
Yes! Cut it in rhombuses, right?
Mh.
Yes... Parallel lines, then.
we'll do it in other direction.
And now in the other direction.
We do it, so the meat marinates
better and cooks faster.
We're putting it to marinate.
I'm putting this piece in there.
Mh.
It will be cut, Romas.
We'll cover others...
It looks excellent. We will
marinate for at least a couple
of hours.
The have marinated. We've
been marinating for about a
couple of hours.
Take it, dry it off like that
and put it in like that.
The smell is excellent as well.
The smell is really good.
Mh.
And we're adding some olive
oil. Not much is need.
Later on, when the meat is
cooked a bit we'll add potatoes
and beans.
The temperature is set to 200 C
[390 F]. We'll cook it in this
temperature, then we lower it,
so the meat gets hot.
The meat have been cooking for
15 minutes. We are chopping the
potatoes now.
We're cutting them into quarters,
but you can do as you want.
We're adding some ahh... salt
on potatoes.
That we'll be enough.
Take it to film it. Here look.
Okay, are you holding?
Mh.
Try not to get your fingers
in the frame.
Film it now, so that we can...
move it a bit... see what I'm
doing.
Okay, now we'll... ahhhhh...
Add.
We'll add some pepper. I
mean we'll grind some. How's
that word?
To grind.
To grind. I see. Film it from
above, so we can see it better.
Okay?
Okay, it'll be enough.
Okay.
Mix the potatoes.
Gave us some vapor.
The cockroaches are done here...
Okay, we'll take the meat out
and put the potatoes in.
Ahh! Excellent!
We're adding the potatoes.
I'll put the potatoes everywhere
then I'll add the beans which we
don't have a lot of.
Mh.
We're adding some olive oil.
Most of it on the potatoes.
We'll add beans later.
Those will cook fast.
We're putting it back and
we'll see how long it will
take.
We have been cooking for
about 20 minutes.
With potatoes?
Yes, around, almost.
We'll lower the temperature to
150 C [300 F].
That's fine.
We're pouring some liquid
over the meat, potatoes. If
you're using larger potatoes,
you can add them at the same
time as the meat, so they will
cook at the same time.
We'll make the sauce now.
Mmm... for the meat. It's needed
around half a cup of honey. You
have to melt it,
because it's not liquidy here.
We're adding a cup of brown
sugar.
And about 4 tablespoons of
soy sauce.
Mix everything well!
We've put some salt and we'll
add beans to cook now.
We'll put them into the empty
spots.
The meat have been cooking
for 1 h 20 minutes.
So we are taking it out.
Maybe we should pour some
of the liquid out, Romce?
No, it will be fine.
Look at this beauty!
Heh.
We're pouring some sauce on.
On the meat.
This is how covered meat looks
like.
We have some sauce left, but
it's okay. We'll use it next time.
We're increasing the temperature
to 260 C [500 F].
And we'll cook for around 20
minutes or half hour depending
on the situation.
We've been cooking for around
20 minutes and we are lowering
the heat to 150 C [300 F],
because we're waiting for
mother.
We can eat it now basically.
Maybe you should put it to
100 C [210 F], Romas?
We can lower it even more.
Lower it to 100 C [210 F] and
it's fine.
We're lowering it 100 C [210 F],
just to keep the temperature.
So, the total cooking... Total
cooking time was around 2
hours.
We'll take it out and eat.
Look at this nicely browned
top!  
MO is putting the meat to the
plate.
She's also adding some
potatoes.
We're adding some beans.
Now is tasting time.
This is how it looks.
Mmmh.
Very tasty, MO!
Really?
Mh.
Just like Gustvas', right?
Better.
"Mmm" and he falls under the
table.
Thank you for making it, MO!
You're welcome!
I would like to thank the
increasing number of fans.
Which we have over 60 now.
Thank you for subscribing and
those who haven't can do that.
Comment it, like it and until
next time. Bye!
Bye!
Oh, Terra, it's so hot!
Romas, where is that paper?
So, gourmet?
It's tasty.
Very tasty.
Mh.
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hehehe... Hello!
Say it!
Hehehe... All you want to do
is make food.
Aha. What will we make on this
episode?
Hehe... Potatoe cake.
Mh. What will we need?
Lithuanian potato, Lithuanian
sour cream, 
Mh.
Lithuanian milk.
Mh.
Lithuanian oil.
Mh.
Lithuanian onions.
Mh.
Pepper. [They can be not
Lithuanian ;DD]. And salt. 
Mh.
We'll grate the potatoes now.
We're chopping the onion.
Not one. We'll chop 3 onions,
little Romas.
3... But we have 4 here.
4, yes. We'll leave for the
bacon pieces.
I see.
We're adding the onions.
To the grated potatoes, right?
Yes.
We pouring boiling milk.
And mix everything well.
How much milk there was?
A litre or less?
Half a litre, Romas.
That will be plenty enough.
We're adding some pepper.
Salt.
We're adding some sour
cream.
How much of it?
Whatever I have left...3
good tablespoons, little 
Romas.
We're mixing everything well.
It's rather a lot to add.
Yes, little Romas. Otherwise it
will be dry.
And we're adding some oil
which we need rather lot.
Mix everything well.
We're adding some oil to
the baking tray.
Spread it evenly, including the
sides.
And we're pouring everything
in.
You can even it out.
That's enough, Romas. Mother
will cook a pancake from the
rest.
Okay, we could make a pancake
from the rest.
Is the oven ready?
The temperature in the oven
is set to 200 C [390 F].
We're adding potato cake
to cook.
Kugel or in other words potatoes
cake has been cooking for about
40 minutes and now we'll change
to wet - damp [hot] air, right?
This is how it looks. It might
look differently on your oven.
And the temperature...
We'll increase [leave]
temperature at 200 C [390F].
We'll leave the temperature the
same.
We'll leave at 200 C [390 F],
so the potato cake is a bit
wetter.
We're preparing bacon pieces.
We'll just fry them a bit now.
Bacon pieces have fried, so we
adding some onions now.
And we'll fry them a bit more.
Bacon pieces are done.
It's almost done.
Almost.
We can actually switch it off
now.
Total cooking time is about
1 h 40 minutes.
...
So, we are taking the
potato cake out.
Here look at its quality.
It cooked very well.
She's adding some potato
cake.
We're adding some bacon
pieces.
You can also add this thing if
you want.
It's curd and what else?
Dill?
Dill, garlic.
Mh.
I'll try it now.
Mh.
Very well cooked. An
excellent taste
So, thank you, MO, for making
it!
You are welcome!
What will you say to your
viewers?
Tasty dinner.
Mh.
Thank you for watching,
subscribing, comments, likes
and until next time!
Bye!
Bye!
You have got to be kidding
with such a large piece, MO!
Look at it!
Please, stop it, Romas...
I mean it, look at it!
Mh. I know it's yours!
So, are you ready for filming?
That's my brush.
Okay. Hello, everyone, hello,
MO!
Hello!
On this episode we'll colour
the eggs and boil them, so it's
more like 
not only how to boil the egg,
but also how to colour it as
well using a...
Method with wax.
What will we need? I see some
sort of tool.
Yes. Hehehe. My painting
brush.
Okay. What do we have here?
Here we have some boiled
red onion peels.
Mh.
And yellow.
They are boiled and cooled off.
Yes, yes, yes.
Here we have eggs.
Eggs, wax and that's it. A piece
of cloth.
A piece of cloth, yarn.
Yeah.
And scissors.
Hehehehe.
You can add some herbs if
you have and then add some
onion peels
and there'll be a print of
the herbs, right?
Yes, yes, yes.
But spring is rather early this
year...
It's late... Hehehe. Easter is
early.
Yes. Easter is rather early and
spring is a bit late.
So, that's why we can't collect
any herbs.
So, roll it around.
The onions are pressed well.
Mh.
Okay, that will be fine.
Cut the yarn.
We'll put them in to soak.
Let's do others. Oh. Our pot
will certainly be big enough.
Here.
An put them in.
Okay.
We turning the gas on.
A really small flame.
It's good.
Let me.
We're putting the wax on and
let it melt.
The wax has melted.
We'll see if it stick to the
egg or not.
I would like to mention that
it's better to use natural wax,
because it sticks better.
So. Put the tip of the tool into
the wax and then draw something.
However you can.
Whatever patterns you want.
Yes.
Whatever "shoots" to your head.
Yes.
This is how MO works.
I'll let you, if you want.
But this smell is like bees,
right?
Yes... Pure Lithuanian wax.
Mh.
This is how the egg looks like.
So, we adding the egg to the
colour.
And we'll keep it for 5 hours.
I think it will "bite" [paint]
the eggs. There aren't many
of them.
Okay. It's time to do other
things. That's enough of
posing for you!
About 5 hours have passed.
We'll...
Look it had bitten pretty well.
It will be fine.
And we'll put the eggs to boil
now.
I wouldn't put them on a really
strong fire, so they wouldn't
start cracking.
Okay.
How long will we boil them for?
Probably around 4 minutes?
4 minutes after it start boiling.
Mh.
But it's a thing you know. It
depends on what hardness of eggs
you like.
The eggs are boiling, so we'll
boil them for about 4 minutes.
We are turning the heat off.
We'll take the eggs out and put
them into the cold water. Let's
hope they won't crack.
Let's hope.
How beautiful this is!
Such nice quality!
The wax has fallen off [melted]
and there's a pattern left.
Mh.
Let's open this egg as well.
What do we have here?
So... Look at this quality!
It's really not bad. Look!
It's not bad.
Hehehe.
Okay.
Of many colours. There's no need
for any colours, no nothing.
Everything is natural.
In a natural way.
But it has bitten [painted]
really well.
Yes.
They have soaked in colour...
There will be no tasting,
because the taste is like an
egg.Most of have tasted the egg.
Hehe.
So, thank you for watching,
subscribing, commenting,
liking and so on.
It's really nice seeing that
there are more and more
subscribers.
So, thank you and untl next
time! Bye!
Bye!
Did you have any bees in
the village, MO?
Yes.
A lot?
10 beehives.
And how much honey did
they bring?
It depended on summer.
But roughly...
If summer was nice they would
bring 10-12 buckets.
Mh.
In total, right?
Yes.
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello!
On this episode we'll make
Mediterranean poultry. We
will need.
What ingredients?
What do we have here?
A duck. [Or a chicken].
Mh.
Tomatoes.
Yes.
Some thyme here.
Thyme, olive oil, 
Aha.
Pasta, basil.
Yes.
Pepper.
Mh.
Salt, garlic, pepper, lemon.
And?
Red wine vinegar.
[And some hard cheese
(parmesan or something like
that).]
Ideally you should use balsamic
vinegar, but we don't have it.
We're adding some basil to
the mortar.
We're adding some salt.
Crush it.
We're adding some thyme.
Ideally you should use...
Fresh ones, but we don't
have them.
We're adding about half
of teaspoon of pepper.
We're adding some olive oil.
Mh.
And crush everything well.
The marinate is ready.
We can take off a hair from
this duck if we find any. 
Take the marinate and put
it on the duck.
It's a very tasty thing here.
Take the marinate and rub
the duck very well.
I have been calling it a
chicken.
Heh.You are probably more
interested in chikens and
ducks. Heheh.
I don't eat it often, so it's 
difficult to remeber.
Don't forget inner organs.
Rub it... Hehehe.
To rub the inside, not the
organs.
Yes, yes, Okay, there aren't
any organs inside.
We'll keep for a couple of
hours to marinate.
Mh.
We're pouring some oil to the
baking tray.
Spread the oil.
We're adding tomatoes.
Okay, take a garlic and crush
it between the knife.
And put it in the baking tray.
We're adding about 2
normal - sized garlic bulbs.
Stab a lemon with a knife.
Mh. And we're putting a lemon
into the du.. duck.
We're adding the bars.
And the duck on top.
I'll put it like that.
Mh. Okay.
Pour the sauce [marinate]
if you have any left.
Mm.
The oven.
Mh.
Mm. Okay. Now we're putting
the duck in to cook.
The temperature is set to
200 C [392 F]. And program
is called thermal heater.
But maybe your... Mmm... 
Your...
These settings were chosen
according to the manual.
So, you should look at your
manual and decide which
program is the best for you
to cook the duck.
The duck is in the oven.
We'll cook it for about 1 h
20 minutes to 2 hours.
We'll need to watch it and
see if the duck is cooked.
Here.
Pour a glass of water. You can
do that at the beginning. We
waited a bit.
Ahh... How nicely it is cooking!
We'll glaze it a bit.
There are a lot of liquid
inside.
The lemon will help to
marinate.
The lemon is like a bomb
as Jamie Oliver says which
in a way explodes when
cooking.
So, yes, this recipe is based
on Jamie Oliver's recipe.
Hehehe... Is it RO's?
Romas and MO have only
adapted it.
We'll make it, right?
An we're putting it back.
We've turned the duck over
and we'll cook this side. Then
we might
change it to the original
position.
It's ready, Romas.
We've turned it over and we'll
cook it a bit more.
But it's finishing cooking
It's really finishing.
We're adding some salt to
the boiling water.
And we're adding our pasta.
You can use long spaghettis.
You can use whatever you like.
How long will we boil?
About 3 minutes, Romas. They
will stay in the water.
Mh.
They'll soften.
Okay, it's time to take the
duck out.
Look how excellent it looks.
We've moved the duck to the
bowl.
Take the tomatoes off the
twig.
We are adding garlic without
the cover.
Crush everything.
[We're adding] red wine vinegar.
Ideally you should use balsamic
vinegar, but we don't have, so
we'll use this one.
So, around 4-5 tablespoons.
Mix everything well.
We're adding some duck
liquid to the sauce.
We're pouring the sauce on
the duck.
And we'll cook the duck a bit
more.
Pour the water out of the pasta.
We're adding the sauce to the
pasta.
We've added some basil leaves.
We're mixing everything now.
Grate some hard cheese such as
parmesan, but if yoy don't have
it, you can use simple cheese.
Mix everything well.
[We have been cooking it for
about 1 h 45 minutes].
Look what happened. Can you see
it?
What?
[It's black all around].
Beautiful?
Beautiful.
So?
Ughhh...
I got so hot after making this.
Hehe.
We're cutting some duck off.
The duck is on the plate.
We're addind some pasta.
Hehe.
What is it? Why are you
laughing?
The cheese is streching.
It's okay.
We're grating some cheese on
top.
And we're adding some basil
leaves.
It's time to try it now!
Mmm. It's very tasty for sure.
You'll see when you try it, MO.
So, thank you, for making it...
For making it for half a day!
But they say that the first
time is always long.
Heh.
You won't be dissapointed when
you try it.
Okay.
Thank you viewers for... 
watching, subscribing, 
commenting, for everything
we thank you!
Write it down what you like to
make or how you managed to make
this recipe.
So, thank you and until next
time. Bye!
Okay. Have a tasty dinner!
But, MO, did you think there
will ever be let say 50
subscribers?
I did, because it is so tasty to
eat everything! All you have to
do is make and try it!
Don't be lazy. Watch MO, right?
And learn.
Yeah. Look at Terra which is
never lazy.
We'll film it...
Mh.
Okay. Hello, everyone, hello,
MO!
Hello!
Tell us what we'll make today.
We'll maka a duck.
The first title [word] is
Medieval...
Wait, I said it wrong...
Hello! Romas... and MO's
kitchen.
No, really we're filming it.
Have you stopped recording?
So?
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello!
On this episode we will be
making a pork chop with
bell peppers and onions.
So. What ingredients will we
need to make this dish?
Pork sirloin.
Mm-hm.
Bell peppers.
Yes.
Blue onion, garlic...
Thyme.
Thyme, butter, sugar, salt,
olive oil, red...
Red wine vinegar.
And basil.
Cut the edges of the chops.
So, it wouldn't curl when
cooking, right?
Yes.
Okay, add some pepper now.
Mh.
We can move it to the side.
We'll add some pepper.
We're adding some salt.
Tap it on the meat.
Hehe.
Turn it over and do the same.
Add some salt. I mean add
some pepper.
And some salt.
Tap it on the meat.
And we're letting the meat to
rest a bit.
Slice bell peppers.
We're using one bell pepper
for one chop.
The bell peppers are cut and
we will now cut the blue onion.
We'll use 1 blue onion for 2
chops.
We're now crushing the garlic.
We're using 1 small garlic bulb
for 2 chops.
We're adding some olive oil.
And we'll heat the pan.
We're adding all vegetables.
We're frying them on high heat,
because we want to roast them.
We're adding some peppers.
We're adding some salt.
And we're adding some sugar.
So, 1 tablespoon for 2 bell
peppers.
Mix everything well.
We're adding some red wine
vinegar.
1 bell needs about 0.5
tablespoon.
It will certainly be  enough.
We're chopping the basil.
We're adding the basil in.
And mix everything well.
The vegetables are fried.
We're taking the vegetables
out and putting them into the
seperate plate.
You can cover them, so they
don't cool off completely.
We're preheating the plate.
We're adding some olive oil.
We're adding pork chops in. Be
careful! Add them "from
yourself", not "to yourself",
so you wouldn't splash on
yourself.
We're adding the garlic.
We're adding some thyme.
How much of the thyme were
there? About 2-3 sprigs?
Yes.
So, 1 chop needs about 1
thyme sprig.
The chops have just been
turned over.
After frying them for a bit,
we're adding some butter.
This is the sound, MO... The
sound of taste!
Keep putting some sauce on
the chops.
So, they would  fry more
equally.
And they'll be juicier.
Yes, and juicier.
Look at this quality. How good
they look!
This sauce... It's just
incredible!
The meat is ready!
We can turn it off.
We're adding the veagetables.
You can hear pork chop still
frying in the background!
Jumping in the pan.
And we're adding the chop now.
Here.
...
Look at this chop! Decorations!
How nicely everything looks!
It's definetely tasty as well!
Wait a bit before eating, so
some of the juicies get back
into the chop.
And of course it's time to try
it now.
Mh.
Very tasty chop, You cannot
imagine that, MO!
So, thank you for making it!
Here. Thank you!
Okay.
Heh.
I would also like to... Ah...

Yes, butter.
Aha. We're adding some sugar.
Maybe we should talk how much
curd we have here.
Here we have 2 packs...
360 g [12.7 oz.].
Yes. 360 g [12.7 oz.]. 2 packs
of 180 g [6.3 oz.].
How much sugar is needed?
2 teaspoons will be enough.
1 block of curd needs 1
teaspoon of sugar.
Some salt.
We'll add this starch, we don't
have a lot of it.
It's about a teaspoon of starch.
So, 1 block of curd needs about
0.5 of sugar.
And half of the egg for 1 block
of curd.
Mix everything well.
We're adding some flour. How
much of them are we adding, MO?
Probably a good cup.
Mh. So, about half cup of flour
for each block of curd.
We'll see when I mangle it.
This is how manlged batter
should look like.
So, what are we doing here?
Adding some flour on the...
I'll be adding those.
Ah. You'll add these prepared
ones.
Yes. my pruduct.
Yes.
Nip off a smaller piece of
batter and make roll it to make
sort of cylinder.
A long macaroni, right?
Mh.
And cut it in small pieces just
like that.
And add it to the plate.
While MO is preparing curdies,
let's boil some water.
The water is boiling, so we are
adding some salt.
And we're adding the curdies.
How long will they boil for?
It'll be very fast.
But roughly. A couple of minutes?
Yes, a couple of minutes after
they start boiling, Romas.
We'll boil the curdies a bit
more after the water starts
boiling.
The curdies have started rising
to the top but it doesn't mean
they are ready.
They have to start boing at
first...
After it starts boiling, you
have to leave it for boiling.
Yes, yes.
So we'll prepare the sauce now.
We'll melt the butter and your
sauce will be done.
Yes, a very simple sauce.
They are...
Turn it off.
Okay, I'm turning it off. The
curdies are...
Turn it off... Look!
The curdies have started getting
out of  the pot... Oh it's
spilling...
Heh.
I have spilled some...
You are bad...
Guard.
Okay, the sauce has melted as
well.
We're adding the curdies in.
I won't be adding all of them to
you.
No, no that's enough for me.
Okay, thank you!
Hehe.
We're pouring some sauce over.
Look how nicely it looks! Look
at it!
People will tell us to give them
some of them!
An now of course is tasting.
Mh. The curdies are really
tasty, MO!
It good that they are tasty.
So, thank you for making them!
You are welcome that you'll
like this supper.
Yes, yes, it be great. I would
like to thank the viewers for
watching, subscribing,
liking and commenting.
And... It's really nice that
there're more and more viewers.
So, thank you and until next
time! Bye!
Bye!
Qualitative, MO?
Qualitative, MO?
Tasty.
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello!
On this episode a special
dish - Orange Chicken.
A lot of required ingredients.
Hehe.
We'll need to make it.
Chicken, egg, oranges, sugar.
Here it is. Salt, brown sugar.
Ahh... Chili flakes.
Sesame oil, vinegar, oil. Ah...
Starch, garlic, ginger. Amm...
Pepper, soy sauce and flour.
Cut the chicken in cubes.
I would like to say that we
will be using a kilo [2.2 lb]
of chicken
and I will say the amount
of spices for a kilo [2.2 lb].
We're adding a tablespoon
of salt.
A teaspoon of pepper.
We're adding a cup of starch.
Or in other words about
250 ml [8.5 fl. oz.].
I would like to say that all
amounts are said for 1 kilo
[2.2 lb] of chicken.
And we're adding 3 cups of
flour.
Crack one egg in.
And we're adding 1.5 cup
of water.
Mix everything well.
Okay, we're adding 2
tablespoons of oil.
Mix everything well.
If needed add more water.
That's enough.
This is how the batter
should look like.
Add the chicken.
Mix everything well.
The chicken is mixed in. We're
covering it with a bag and leave
it in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Okay, that's it.
We'll now squeeze some orange
juice. I would like to say that
you can use
simple orange juice instead
of freshly squeezed oranges.
The orange is squeezed. It's
a mess here.
It's probably easier to use
orange juices.
Hehehehe.
Don't forget to clean from time
to time, so it's not that messy.
Stop it...
This is how squeezed juices
look like.
Fresh.
Turn the heat on.
And we're heating the oil.
We'll be eating this dish with
some rice, so we're slowly
heating the water.
The chicken have been marinating
for about half an hour and now
we'll deep fry them.
We're adding the chicken to
deep fry.
And we'll deep fry for about
6 minutes, right?
Yes.
So, the chicken has to similar
colour like this. It will also
get a bit yellower
after taking out.
An excellent chef with a mesh
skimmer.
Yes, of course.
We're putting the chicken on the
paper towel on which... the oils
will collect.
And we're putting more to
cook... I mean to deep fry.
This is how much chicken we got
from 1 kilo [2.2 lb]. How 
nicely it looks!
Okay, that's it, Romas.
We'll make a sort of sauce.
We're adding some oil.
We're adding some chili flakes.
Around 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon.
We're adding half teaspoon of
ginger.
We're adding 1 tablespoon of
garlic.
Mix a little bit.
You smell ginger instantly!
We're adding 1/4 cup of sugar.
We're adding... Ahh... 1/4 cup
of brown sugar.
We're adding 1/4 cup of orange
juice.
It smells of oranges now.
Mmh.
And we're adding around 1/4 cup
of vinegar.
We're adding around 2 tablespoons
of soy sauce.
Mix it a little bit.
We're preparing a starch slurry
here.
Around a couple tablespoons of
starch and around the same
amount of water.
Watch the consistency of the
sauce. We didn't add everything.
And we're adding starch slurry.
We divided the chicken into 2
parts, because we don't have
that much space
and now we'll add it to fry it.
Not like to fry it, but more
like to cover it with the sauce.
And of course mix everything
well with the sauce.
Make it hotter.
Okay, I'll increase the
temperature.
I doesn't have to be very high,
but you can certainly increase
it.
We noticed that you can make
sauce for the chicken.
This is how 2 perfectly
chicken-filled pans look like.
The tasting is coming up! Hehe.
We're adding some rice.
I would to mention that you
have to add sesame oil, so
I'll add some on top now.
Don't add much.
Yes. Okay. I'll just add some
here.
I'll add some here as well.
Look at how nicely it looks!
It looks excellent!
Decorations and everything looks
really well here!
And now of course the most...
Pleasurable job.
... pleasurable job is to try
it.
Mm.
It's really not worse than in
the restaurant. So...
I would like to say that it is
really really good!
Thank you for making it!
Okay!
Thank you viewers for watching,
subscribing, liking and
commenting.
And...
The tastiest dish ever.
One of the tastiest for sure.
Thank you again, MO. Thank
you, viewers!
And until next time! Bye!
Bye!
We're cutting the chicken.
I'll get it.
"Kitchen is listening."
Yeah, yeah.
Hello, MO's kitchen!
Yesh, we're filming!
Grandmother will call later...
Chicken with oranges...
Yeah... Okay, bye!
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello!
On this episode we'll be making
fish fingers and a sandwich with
... What?
With potatoes.
Okay. What ingredients will we
need to make it?
First of all, we'll need fish.
Yes.
Fish fillet. Here we have sea
pike fillet.
Mh.
Potatoes.
Yes.
Eggs.
Mh.
Dill, salt.
Mh.
Pepper.
Mh.
Fish spices.
Paprika.
Red paprika.
Flour.
Yes.
Butter.
White bread.
Yes, "baton".
Rusks and oil.
We're cutting the potatoes
in shoestrings lengthwise.
We'll add later...
We're adding just a little bit
of salt.
Okay that will be enough. That's
it.
After the water boils, we'll
boil the potatoes for 2-3
minutes.
We're cutiing the fish, so the
pieces are about the same size.
Put some pepper and salt on the
fish.
We've put some pepper on the
fish. We're adding some salt
now.
You can press down on the fish
a bit and we'll leave it to...
How to say? Marinate basically.
Here we have some rusks and
we're cutting some dill now.
And we're mixing them with
the rusks,
The potatoes have just started
boiling. We'll boil them for 3-4
minutes.
We're adding some flour.
We're adding some fish spices.
We're cracking some eggs in.
And we're mixing everything.
The potatoes have been boiling
for about 4 minutes. We're
turning it off.
We're pouring the water out.
We're adding some oil to the
baking tray.
We're putting our half-boiled
potatoes in. We're adding some
salt.
Some paprika.
And we're mixing, so everything
is evenly covered.
I think we should add more.
Agh-agh...
I think we should add some.
Some more.
Don't add more peppers
[paprika]. That's enough.
And we're adding potaotes to
cook... 180 C [360 F] for about
20 mnutes.
Take a piece of meat and roll it
between your palms to make
a similar shape to a finger.
We're putting the fish in the
battered eggs and then into the
rusk and dill mixture.
i can help you, MO.
No, no, Romas. You better...
No, I'll help you. Here.
Good, very good. Cover them
several times. It will be much
faster.
You see how nice this is. That's
enough.
Mh.
You'll use all of the rusks.
You see how qualitatively we
work.
Yeees. It'll be 100 times
faster.
You can also work together when
making KFC. If 2 persons are
doing, it's much faster.
Or when making Chicken Kievs.
It's much easier when you make
them together.
One - to the battered eggs,
the other - to the rusks.
Eggs - rusks.
Your hands don't get that
messy.
We're adding some oil to the
pan.
We're adding the fingers to fry.
We're turning the fish fingers
over.
Look, MO, how qualitatively they
look.
Look at this beauty!
Okay, beauty. I see.
The potatoes have been cooking
for around 20, so we're turning
it off now.
[You can use a toast]. 
We're covering one side of
the white bread with butter
If you want, of course you can
cover both sides.
Oh come on. You'll be eating
fats then.
But if you want.
If you like the fats, right?
Yes.
We'll finish fish fingers
in the butter.
You have to...
We're increasing the
temperature.
I'll pour some sauce over.
Yes, we'll cover it with some
butter.
We're pouring the sauce over
the fingers.
It smell really good, right?
Yes, yes.
The fingers are finishing
cooking, so we'll turn it off.
Here come the fries.
We're taking the potatoes out.
Take a piece of white bread and
rub into the baking tray.
Here... This what I'm talking
about.
We're adding  the potatoes on
the white bread.
Aha. Then we add the other
piece of white bread.
And we're cutting the sandwich.
And we're adding some fish
fingers.
Look at this beauty.
Homemade fish fingers and
potato sandwich.
It real excellence!
And now of course the tasting.
I would like to say that...
You can eat fish fingers with
your favourite sauce whether
that's 
tomato ketchup or barbeque. It
doesn't matter. Eat it with
whatever you like.
Mmm.
So, MO?
What?
Go there.
"Go there",
Yeah, go there.
I can say that homemade fish
fingers are very tasty. Thanks

We're adding some beets.
How much will we add?
We'll add 3 tablespoons and
then we'll see...
We'll see.
If it needs more.
Okay, we're adding 3

How to see if we have enough
beets? According to the colour?
Or what?
According to the consistency.
I think I'll add a tablespoon

We're adding more beets.
So, we've added 4 tablespoons.
Okay, potatoes have boiled.
They're without water.
Yes, they're without any water.
Yes, yes.
You can add some dill.
You can also add some fried
bacon pieces, but we...
We're not eating it with them
usually.
We're adding some egg.
Okay, I'll try it now. I eat it
like that.
I'm adding some potatoes.
Hehe... So, the soup is not
cold.
I don't know. I just like it
like that. And then I just eat
it with potatoes.
Hehehehe...
So your throat wouldn't hurt,
right?...
M-hm.
Because of the cold soup.
Mh.
It's very tasty.
So... Hello, MO. Thank you for
making it.
Okay.

Around a kilo, right?
A precise kilo [2.2 lb], little
Romas.
Okay, here we have 4
tablespoons of sugar.
Mh.
And we're adding some sour
cream.
4 tablespoons.
We adding some raisins.
About a half cup of raisins, but
you can add them according to

You can cook raisin free.
We're mixing it.
We're mixing the eggs.
We'll use 4 eggs for a
kilo [2.2 lb] of curd.
And we're adding some
semolina. How much will we
add?
Mhhh... 3...
Mh.
4. Maybe 5 should be enough.
We're... We've just added 5
tablespoons of semonila.
I'll see how it looks after we
add some eggs. Maybe it will
enough.
This is how professionals mix
the eggs.
We're adding beaten eggs.
Here we have a baking tray 
with buttered cooking paper
and semolina on it.
So, it would stick even less.
We're adding all batter to
the baking tray.
We're smoothing the casserole
to make same height at all
places.
Okay. What are we doing now?
Cutting butter in small pieces.
And we're adding them to the
casserole.
Give me some sour cream. I'll...
Okay.
... from the fridge I'll add
some to the top.
And we're adding some sour
cream on top and smooth the
surface.
You can do it like that
with a fork.
So...
That's it.
The casserole is ready.
Here you are!
Aha.
We're putting it to cook now.
The temperature is set to
200 C [390 F].
The upper and lower cooki...
The upper and lower heating
program.
And we'll cook it for about an
hour.
Good-bye and cook!
Good-bye, casserole, right?
Oh my, God! Oh my, God, Romas!
We opened the oven to check
if the casserole is cooked.
How to do that, MO?
Put your finger in. What?
Okay, take a wooden toothpick
...
And if it easily
It's cooked!
It's cooked, because it doesn't
stick to the toothpick.
Ah... If it doesn't stick, it
means it's ready. Okay.
Turn it off. That's it, Romas.
Okay, I'm turning it off. It has
been cooking for around 1 hour
20 minutes.
Look at this quality, MO!
It looks so nice. You can see
your picture.
Yeah... I'm an artist.
Yes, yes.
Let it be for some time. Then...
We'll cut it.
Yeah.
It's a shame to cut such a
nice casserole, right, MO?
Mh.
Such a nice one!
Look at it. How nicely it's
cooked.
We're adding it to the plate.
Will one piece be enough for
you?
Yes, it'll be enough.
It'll be enough at first.
You can eat this casserole
with sour cream. Or you can
eat it without sour cream.
However you like.
With the jam.
We'll add some jam on top.
We have some plum jam, but you
can eat it with whatever you
like. Cherry, strawberry, 
I would also say that it's
grandmothers', right, MO?
Yes, of course.
Whose else can it be?
Here you are.
Thank you!
Try it!
Look at how nicely it looks!
Look at this quality!
It's like a desert, but you can
actually get full from it.
I've added some more of the
jam and now I'll try it.
Mmm.
Very tasty casserole, MO.
Grandmother is making more
servings.
Thank you viewers for watching.
For the increasing number of
watchers... For commenting,
liking.
And until next time. Bye!
Bye!
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello!
On this episode we will make
sweet Moroccan chicken. What
will we need to make it, MO?
First of all, the most important
thing.
Chicken.
Mh.
Here?
Tomatoes, finely chopped
garlic, parsley.
Mh.
Here?
Onions, raisins...
And here we have a lot of
spices.
Tell these spices.
Here we have turmeric, paprika,
thyme, ahhh... black pepper...
Coriander and chili flakes.
Here we have salt and olive
oil.
We're are adding some salt.
We'll add some spices now. I
would like to say
that each quarter needs 0.5 
teaspoon of each spice. 
A bit less than a tablespoon of
olive oil for 1 quarter.
We'll add 4 tablespoons.
While MO is mixing I would
like to mention that you can buy
these beautifull wooden items
at the link in description
below.
Of course you can mix the spices
together at the beginning, so it's
easier.
We're adding the tomatoes.
So, it's about...1 smaller
tomato for 1 quarter. 
About 2 cloves of garlic for 1
chicken quarter.
How much parsley did you chop,
MO?
I didn't weigh.
We can say it's some.
Yes, it's not...
Let's say it's 1 teaspoon for 1
quarter.
That much for sure.
Yes, so 1 teaspoon for 1
quarter.
Mix everything well.
The chicken is on the fire and
we'll stew it now.
We're adding the lid on.
The vapour is forming.
We've been stewing for about 5
minutes and now we're adding
some water.
Add some more. I think.
So, it alsmost covers it all.
Tititi... As I said... go here, 
behind me.
Mh.
So, I would like to congratulate
you with 100 subscribers, MO!
It's 102 as I've just noticed.
So... Move to the side...
Heh.
You're stupid.
Hhhhh... Heheh...
Hehehe...
Romas!
It was a bit too loud!
Hehehe...
Stupid...
Hehehehehehe...
So...
Congratulations again! I have a
ticket for you.
Hehehe...
Here. You might win something.
Okay, thank you!...
Hehehe...
A jester!
Festive atmosphere is great, but
you have to clean afterwards.
Yeah, it's needed.
It's been 15 minutes since we
added the chicken, so we are
adding the onions now.
We're using 1 smaller onion
for 1 quarter.
We're adding some raisins.
We using 50 g [1.8 oz.] for 1
quarter.
We're covering and leaving to
stew.
We've tasted our Maroccan
chicken and decided to add more
raisins.
So, we're adding 20 g [0.8 oz.]
for each quarter.
So, the stew is ready. It had 
been stewing for around 50
minutes.
Here. The rice is in.
And we're adding the chicken,
Mh... Such a nice smell.
Right, MO?
Ah...
Mh.
We're adding the sauce.
We're adding some liquid.
Look at this beauty! It's crazy!
The chicken, the decorations.
Everything is so nice here!
So nice and so tasty!
And of course I'll try it now...
Look at this white meat.
White?
Yes, yes. It's very well stewed!
Mmm...
It's very tasty, MO!
You haven't dissapointed wtih

Don't talk nonsense... You know

years.
Faster...
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello!
On this episode we're making a
special dish - Soviet Burger by
Eastern European.
That's why I and MO are wearing
some special clothing today! We
are all dressed-up!
Dressed-up nicely!
Okay, so what will need to make
this dish, MO?
Minced pork.
Mh.
White bread.
You can use black.
Yes. An egg, garlic.
We'll use garlic and mayonnaise
to make the sauce.
Salt, pepper, oil.
We'll prepare the meat now. So,
we'll add some pepper. Let me
know how much is needed, MO,
according to your opinion.
It depends how you like it. If
you want it to be hotter, when
add more of them.
What do you think? Is it enough?
Add a little bit more.
We're adding some pepper.
Okay.
Yes.
Some salt.
We' won't be adding a lot of
salt, because...
And...
Won't the egg be too large?
And we're cracking the egg in.
We have 200 g [7 oz.] of minced
meat here.
I'll get rid of some of the egg
white, so it wouldn't be so
liquidy.
We aren't using all of the egg...
Not all, Romas. it'll be too...
It would be too much...
And mix evrything well.
We're adding the mayonnaise.
Here's 1 large tablespoon and
some more.
Yes, that'll...
Around a couple of teaspoons I
wanted to say.
And... We're adding some garlic.
We've garlic sauce.
Do you think that's enough?
Okay, that will be enough.
Okay.
We're mixing everything.
The meat and the sauce are
ready!
We are turning the heating on.
We're pouring some oil in.
Eastern European says the
larger, the tastier and that's
the better.
And we're adding the patty.
Look, it hasn't heated up yet.
It'll heat up soon.
And it's sizzling now.
We're turning the patty over.
This is how it looks.
Your patty looks really well.
And we'll fry it for another
4 minutes.
Yes.
Our patty is done. We'll take it
out now.
And we'll leave it to cool off
a bit.
The patty had cooled off. We
are adding some of our garlic
sauce now.
We're adding the patty on.
Add some sauce again.
If you have some sauce left,

Here you are.
We're adding the bread on.
Let it be tasty for you!
This is how our Soviet burger
looks like.
Look at it. It's simple...
And tasty.
And probably tasty!
And of course it's time for
tasting now, but before that...
One thing...
Yes. Ammm... We can try it now.
It's difficult to take such a
large burger.
Heh.

They used to be the best.
Mm. They weren't bad. So, really

Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello!
One this episode we will be
making maple glazed pork
chops.
What will we need to make them,
MO?
Pork sirloin.
Yes.
What do we have here?
Olive oil.
Balsamic vinegar.
Maple syrup.
Mh.
Sugar, salt, pepper.
And spices.
Spices.
Chopped garlic.
Aha.
Smoked paprika and onion
powder.
We're adding the spices.
I would like to mention that
I will be saying all spices for
4 chops.
4 chops needs 2 teaspoons
of garlic powder... Not powder,
but minced garlic. 
Ahhh... 2 teaspoons of onion and
1 teaspoon of smoked paprika.
We're mixing everything now.
Add pepper according to your
taste.
Some salt.
We're mixing everything well.
And we're adding some olive oil.
4 chops needs about 2 teaspoons
of olive oil.
Mix everything well.
If your marinate looks too dry
you can add more olive oil.
It's really dry.
Pour it "from the hand".
As much as you need.
Take the chop, put some spices
on and cover both sides nicely.
We forgot to cut the edges, so
we'll do it now.
We're doing a few cuts on each
chop.
Our chops are ready, so we'll
marinate them for about an hour.
We'll make balsamic glaze now.
We'll need.
Ah... Balsamic vinegar, so we're
adding it to the pot.
Turn it on to heat up.
Mh.
Yes. And we're covering with a
lid.
So it boils.
Mh, so it boils.
Okay, so now we're adding
half of what we poured of
balsamic vinegar.
We'll mix it.
Turn down the heat...
Okay...
... and.
And we'll heat it until it boils.
Okay. Our balsamic glaze has
been boiling for several
minutes.
We'll move it to the other
container.
And we'll leave it to cool off.
We'll now prepare the glaze for
the chops.
So, we'll mix in equal parts
maple syrup and ah... balsamic
glaze which we prepared before.
So... 4 chops will need about
40 ml [1.4 fl. oz.]
Both of them. So, we're adding
everything 
And we're adding maple syrup.
Mix everything.
The consistency should be
something like this.
We're adding some olive oil.
Here we have our marinated
chops. So, we'll put them to the
pan to fry.
I would like to mention that
you can use this marinate to
...
To cook meat on fire such as
shashliks or these chops on
fire.
It'll be just fine.
Okay, so we're adding the chops.
This is what you have to be
hearing when cooking the
chops at first.
Sizzling...
About 4 minutes passed, so
we're turning the chops over.
Can you smell it?
It smells great, right?
Mh.
Yes.
Where is my fork, Romas?
Here you are.
We've been frying the chops
for another 4 minutes, so we
are adding the glaze.
We're covering every piece.
And we'll cook it a bit more.
Turn them over and add some
glaze again.
Add some glaze again.
And another minute or two
and the chops will be ready.
The chops are fried.
We're adding the chop now.
Mh.
We'll add some sauce [glaze]
now.
Oh...
I made your plate not clean.
And again...
Look at this incredible chop.
Look at the beauty of this chop!
Look at the colours, decorations!
It's just excellent!
Here... It's time to try it. 
Look how white the meat is.
Excellent!
Beautiful, white?
Everything looks excellent!

Thank you!
Open it up and show it to the
viewers... It's not very... So, 
it is what is...
It won't be bad.
Not bad. No.
The chef is not as good as
the knives.
No, no. The knives are simple.
You will be able to use them.
You have to give me a coin,
because of stupid traditions.
Here you are.
Thank you!
Yeah.
You have to try them.
Oh... They are great at cutting.

Take a piece of meat, put
it in the sauce
and then into the rusks.
Chicken breasts are ready,
we'll put them in to cook.
We are putting the pieces
on the grills.
The oven is at 220 C [430 F].
The program is upper and
lower heating and we are
adding pieces to cook.
We'll cook for around 20
minutes.
We'll change to the bottom

get burned.
So, the chicken breats have been
cooking for around 20 minutes.
We'll turn off the oven as

We're adding some cheese on top.
We'll preapare 1 sandwich with

Hello!
On this episode we will make
a chicken with herbs and lemon.
What will we need to make it?
Chicken... quarters.
Mhm.
What spices do we have here?
Chili flakes.
Aha.
Pepper, oregano, salt, garlic,
vinegar, lemon juices, olive
oil.
Cut chicken, so it cooks and
marinates better and faster.
Sprinkle both sides with salt.
We will prepare the marinate.
We will add spices.
I would like to mention that
I will say all spices for 6
quarters.
So, what do we have here?
1 tspn of  chili flakes, 1 tspn of
pepper
and 2 tspn of oregano.
As I said it's for 6 quarters.
We have more here.
Around 7 cloves of minced
garlic.
Half cup of lemon juices.
A quarter cup of olive oil.
0.5 tbsp of vinegar.
This is how much we have.
Because neighbours need
some.
Not for neighbours...
Pour marinate over.
Rub the marinate well into
the chicken.
Pour the rest of the marinate
in.
We will marinate for a few
hours as much as we can.
Around 2-4 hours.
This marinate is also great
for grilling meat on the fire.
Look at the chicken marinating.
So, the chicken is marinated.
We marinated it for about 2.5
hours.
And we will cook it now. We
are putting it into the baking
tray.
We will now cook it in the oven.
The temperature is 200 C (390 F)
We are using thermal cooking
function.
We will put in the bottom.
And we will cook it for how
long? What do you think, MO?
At least an hour.
About.
More if needed.
Look how excellent it looks.
So, we have been cooking the
chicken for about an hour.
Now we will turn it off and
wait a bit.
And put the chicken on the
plate. Look at how beautifully
it is cooked.
Add some carrots.
Stop it, Romas.
Look at these decorations,
cooked chicken.
Romas...
It's just excellent.
I cut a piece to taste and I am
going to do that.
Look at this white meat.
Mm.

Yeeees.
Butter.
Aha.
"Warmly-smoked" chicken
breast.

Salt, pepper.
Mix the sauce.
One sandwich needs about
two spoons of mayonnaise
and garlic and onion
according to your taste.
Take a piece of bread and 
spread on one side.
We are putting the meat on.
We are putting some cheese on.
Achoo!
Cheese is also according
to your taste. We have 
some cheddar and some
simple cheese.
We are puttin a stensil on.
We can call it like that. You
can easily make one
from the white bread and by
pressing down on it like that.
We are putting some sauce
again.
And put in egg white. Put it
here.
We will use them later.
So?
And the last egg which might 
have...
ehhh... 2 yolks. If that
happens, we will try to
make one more sandwich.
So?
Of course, it's two-yolked.
Oh. It's two. Okay then, we
will make one more sandwich,
It's...
Here.
Aha.
To take it out. Here.
We'll put some peppers on.
I'll put some salt on.
Yes.
And some salt.
You know what? Give me some
cheese and we'll cook it .
Yeah, we'll do it like that.
Yeah.
We'll do it like that. We'll
put one here, one here.
Give me some butter and here.
Aha.
We're adding some butter on
the edges, so it will be
juicier.
The temperature is... Be careful
here.
180 C [360 F] and we'll cook 
for...
To the second?
Put it in the bottom.
We chose program up and bottom 
cooking... Heating
And we'll cook for around 15
minutes.
And then we're adding...
Oh...
Aaah... a yolk on top.
It looks beautiful.
We'll put some salt on.
Because is taking too long,
we're moving to upper
position
and increase the heat...
Temperature, because it's
still rather liquidy.
It'll be faster.
It'll be faster as it was
taking too long.
I said we would cook for
2-5 minutes,
but we cooked for 20 minutes
We're taking everything out.
Total cooking time is about
40 minutes.
Beauties!
It was worth waiting for! Look
at them!
Oh. It's so beautiful.
Take it, you'll film it, MO.
I don't...
Film it, MO!
What if it was...
It'll be fine. From this angle,
okay?
Here.
Terra, please, go away.
Aha. And look.
It's good.
MO is filming.
So, I will try...
Try it.
This amazing excellent
sandwich.
If you want white to be
uncooked... I mean yolk
to be uncooked.
I mean not, so hard. Then
you have to cook for shorter 
period. I like it like that.
Mm.
Come on...
An excellent sandwich!
Great, right?
Mh.
It's really good. Try it, MO.
It's really great!
Mh.
Thank you, MO for this
excellent sandwich. Thank

MO is having a snack.
Yes, yes.
It's really rather high
quality, right, MO?
Mh.
Okay. Hello, everyone, hello,
MO!
Hello!
On this episode we'll be
reheating a pizza MO made
yesterday.
Heh...
No, I'm joking. We bought it.
So, MO will show how to...
You see, it's a bit dried. And
MO will show it how to make
very tasty again!
So...
Okay, turn it on...
We're turning the heat on.
Romce...
We're adding some water in.
You don't need to add a lot
of water, right?
There's no for a lot of it.
We'll add a pizza and it'll
reaheat for you.
We'll put the lid on with the
very low heating.
Yes.
You'll turn the heat completely.
Yes, it'll reheat.
You see the vapour now.
This pizza reheating method is
a great alternative for those
who don't have a microvawe.
For instance, like us who don't
have it, because we don't have
it.
The pizza gets really tasty!
Maybe it's tastier compared to
the one reheated in a microvawe.
You can reheat pancakes like
this.
Yes, you can reheat them...
Yes.
Yes, look at what is happening
here. Look how greaty this pizza
looks!
Like it came from the dead!
Hehehe...
But we'll keep it a bit longer.
Here it is. We've been reheating
it for about 5-6 minutes
on the lowest temperature [heat].
Here it is. Look at it!
It has reheated well.
Yes, for sure.
Mm.
Tasty?
It's almost like a new pizza.
Yes.
Yes.
It's hot, hot.
Yes. So thank you, MO, for
showing this advice for the
viewers...
Okay.
So, until next time!... Next
time... And of course thank you,
viewers, for watching,
commenting, liking, and
good bye!
Good bye!

2 kilos [4.4 lbs] will require
20 cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon

rosemary, 1 teaspoon of
oregano and half a teaspoon
of chili flakes. We're adding
everything in.
Mention that we're making more.
Yes, we have everything almost

making more chicken.
A quarter cup of red wine
vinegar.
And about a half cup of
olive oil.
So, we'll blend everything now.
Our marinate is ready. We'll
add some salt and mix it.
We're pouring the marinate over
the chicken.
Pour the marinate everywhere,
so there wouldn't be any gaps
left.
Just the excellent smell in the
kitchen, right, MO?
Yes, yes.
The chicken is covered with
marinate. We'll marinate it for
about 4 hours.
We'll add the remaining garlic
from the marinate on the
chicken.
We're adding some salt and
pepper.
We're putting it to cook. The
temperature is set to 210 C
[410 F].
The program is set to lower
and upper heating.
We had been cooking the chicken
for about 1 hour, so we'll turn
it off now.
The chicken is ready!
MO's putting some chicken in.
Look how nicely it looks. One
is coming to see it already. The
predator...
Look at this grandmother's
creation. Everything looks
excellent. Decorations,
the chicken, garniture.
And I'll try it now. I nipped
off a piece. Look how well the
meat is cooked.
Mh.
A really excellent recipe.

tasty chicken!
Okay, you are welcome!

You know, MO, you can keep
the chicken overnight [to
marinate].
Yes, yes.
It would have marinated more,
Romas.
Mm-hm.
Hello, everyone, hello, MO!
Hello!
On this episode we will be
making a sorrel soup. What

Simply... Nothing fancy, little
Romas.
We will need boiled natural
chicken stock.
Mh.
Stock in other words.
Yes, stock.
5 small chopped potatoes and
sorrels.
Put chicken stock on the heat.
Put potatoes into the pot.
Cut sorrels.
Sorrels are cut.
Potatoes will soon be ready and
we will put sorrels in and the
soup is ready.
Potatoes are boiling, but we
have to fully boil them.
Potatoes are ready and we 
are adding some sorrels now.
How long will we boil them?
Oh, come on...
1 minute. Sorrels will turn in a
pot and they are done.
The soup is ready. We are
turning off the heat.
Yes!
Look how beautiful the soup is.
Mh.
With carrots from the stock.
Do you see?
Yes.
Such a beautiful soup. All
vegetables are from granny's
garden.
MO's flowers from the garden.
Now it's time to taste the soup.
Isn't it sour?
No, it's excellent.
It's great then.
Thank you for making it, MO.
Okay.
Thank...
For thinking of picking some
sorrels and making you the soup.
Yes, yes.
Thank you, viewers for the

Cheese.
Yes.
Finely chopped ginger.

Broccoli.
Mh.
Corns,
Mh.
Vodka.
Mh.
The most important, right?
Mayonnaise and soy sauce.
Cut the chicken breast, so it
would be flat.
We're adding some vodka. For
8 breasts will use around 50 ml
[1.7 fl. oz].
I would like to mention that
I'll be saying all amounts of
ingredients for 8 bresats.
We're adding 75 ml [2.5 fl. oz]
of soy sauce.
We're adding a tablespoon of
sugar.
And a teaspoon of ginger.
Mix everything well.
And we'll leave it to marinate
for about half an hour.
We're broccoli to boil.
We're pouring the water out.
We're adding the chicken.
We're adding the onions.
We're adding some corns.
We're adding the brocolli on.
And we're adding some cheese
on top.
And we'll put it to cook now.
The temperature is set to
220 C [430 F] and the program
is called thermal heater.
Where do I put it on? On the
first or the second?
Put it on the second one.
We think we'll cook it for 10-15
minutes...
Okay, that's it.
We had increased the
temperature, to 250 C [480 F],
so it would cook faster.
After cooking it for some time,
we'll add some mayonnaise.
We're adding it back to cook.
This is how it looks.
MO's adding some spring onions
on top.
Everything looks very nice.
Look at it!
I'll try it now.
Mh.
It's very tasty!
Will it be good for you?

And with this kind of movements
prepare it.
Dough is ready. We will add

so it wouldn't stick.
You can use breadcumbs instead.
You can make about 4 pizzas
from this piece.
The dough is ready. We will
now add some flour on top.
And we are adding a wet piece of
cloth.
We will wait until the dough 
expands. So, around a couple

So, hello, everyone, to MO's
bathroom!
What is it?
We are here... As said...
Put it in a warm place...
Yes. It is in the warmest place 
of the roo....hom... flat.
It's definitely expanding 
greatly.

semolina in advance.
So the pizza wouldn't stick.
You can use a rolling pin.
Fold the edges of the pizza.
Add some crushed tomatoes.
There are some garlic in it.
Salt.
And.... A little bit of salt.
We poured some olive oil on.
Grate some cheese on top.
Add some parmesan [*mozarella].
Around 50 g [1.8 oz.] for a

Add some basil leaves.
Pour some olive oil again.
And we are adding a pizza for

First things first, we are making a sort of coating for the 
chicken. 
Add 1 and a half teaspoon of salt,
¾ teaspoon of black pepper, 
¾ teaspoon of smoked paprika,

Mix everything well just like MO. 
Add the mixture of spices and cover nicely a kilo or 2.2 
pounds of chicken for our fellow Americans.
Put the chicken on the baking rack with sizeable gaps 
between the pieces. 
I don’t know about you, but it already looks delicious to me 
and I can’t wait to try it. 
Put the chicken into the preheated oven at 220 °C or 430 °F. 
After 20 minutes or so, take the chicken out of the oven and 
turn every piece over. 
Put the chicken back into the oven and cook it for 20-40 
minutes more.
It’s time to make the sauce. 
Add 1/3 to a half cup of Sricracha sauce.
Add ¼ to 1/3 cup of honey to the bowl. 
Then add 1 and a half teaspoon of rice vinegar and some
sesame oil. 
Mix everything. 
Add chicken pieces and cover them thoroughly with the

On this episode we’re making a simple Lithuanian Honey Cake.
First of all, add 4 mixed eggs to 2/3 cup of sugar.
Mix everything well.
A dash of salt.
And here comes one of the most important ingredients – a cup of honey.
Then a cup of sour cream.
Put a large teaspoon of cake spice mix. It consists of nutmeg, clove,
cardamom, all spice, cinnamon and ginger.
Add about 2.5 teaspoons of soda to 1/5 cup of kefir.
Pour it into the mixture and mix everything well.
Add flour and mix until it reaches a consistency like this.
Pour the mixture into the baking tray which has a buttered piece of

Grab a piece!
Ohhh...
Hehehehe.
Isn’t it tasty?
It's really great!
Yes.
Wonderful taste. Pure honey.
Mhm.
Thanks for watching and until next time good-bye!
Good-bye!
We used to make it often at home... God...
We used to make a lot of it when you think about it... Jesus...
Hello and welcome!
I guess hold the meat means hold it and spin it.
Anyway, on this episode we’re making the Beer Pork. Although we’re making
more pork, I’ll be saying all amounts for 1 kilo [2.2 lb.] of meat.
Season the pork with salt and pepper thoroughly on both sides.
Add some olive oil to the pan.
Put about a kilo or 2.2 pounds of pork loin to the pan and fry it until all sides
are equally fried.
It should look something like this. Move the meat to the other container.
Add about 80 g [2.8 oz] of bacon to the pan.
Then 4-5 chopped onions and fry it until the onions soften.
Add 1.5 tablespoons of ketchup.
Put the mixture over the meat.
Then pour some dark beer in until all meat is covered.
Put the meat on medium high heat.
Once it‘s boiling put it in the oven at 200 °C [390 °F] and cook it until it‘s done.
You‘re welcome to add some of your favourite spices. We‘re adding some
chopped garlic.
It has been cooking in the oven for about 1 hour 40 minutes, but the time
depends a lot on the amount of meat you‘re preparing.
Take it out of the oven.
Pour some starch slurry in, until the liquid thickens.
This is how it looks. Not bad...
The meat is a bit bitter, but I like. The taste of course will depend a lot on
the beer you‘re using.
Now, you try it, MO!
Mh-mh-mhm... It's very...
It‘s very tasty!
Okay. So, thanks for watching and until next time. Bye!
Bye!
Ah... Romas, do you want me to...
Hello!
On this episode my grandmother shows a very simple way how to 
make a Cherry Kompot which means a home-made drink.
To make a litre [33.8 fl. oz] of kompot you’ll need to add 200 ml [6.8 fl. oz]
of sugar to 400 ml [13.5 fl. oz] of water.
Stir it and heat it up until it starts boiling. You can of course try
the syrup to see if it is sweet enough for you.
There’s one very important thing to keep in mind.
Both the lid and the jar have to be cleaned and sterilized, so the
kompot could be free of microorganisms as long as possible.
To sterilize them, you can put into the boiling water for a few moments.  
Once you have your syrup boiling, fill the jar with it and close it lightly with a lid.
Cover the jar with a piece of cloth and put it aside.
When the kompot had cooled off, pour the liquid back into the
pot to boil it again.
This is done to lower the chances of microscopic creatures ruining
our kompot.
And of course, we don’t want that.
Once the liquid is boiling, fill the jars with kompot, but, please,
don’t do as MO.
She can only do it like, because she used to the heat.
Close the lid tightly. Turn it over and leave it to cool off.
It’s a very simple way of preserving food. Of course, you can use
different berries and probably fruit,
but bear in mind that different berries might require different 
amounts of ingredients.
Say “thanks for watching”.
Wait.
Come on…
Thanks for watchin’.
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
MO and I would like to thank you for your support. It means a lot to
us. So, again thank you for watching and until next time. Goodbye!
Prepare your preserves in summer, because winter is coming!
Busy season is starting...
We’ll be pickling the cucumbers.
We’ll begin by adding 10 cloves of garlic to a sterilized 1750 ml
or 59.2 fl. oz. jar.
Add a teaspoon of coriander seeds, ¼ teaspoon of black
pepper and 3 allspices.
¼ teaspoon of chili flakes.
3 bay leaves.
Then we’ll be adding a few more exotic ingredients.
Some horse radish leaves.
3 cherry leaves.
3 blackcurrant leaves.
A handful of fresh dill.
Once all the ingredients are in the jar, you’ll need to squeeze
as many cucumbers into the jar as you can.
When the jar seems full, you can add one or more halves.
Fill the jar with boiling water and close it lightly with a sterilized
lid.
Then cover the jar with a piece cloth.
Fill the pot with about a litre or 33.8 fl. oz of water and add
a tablespoon of salt.
5 tablespoons of sugar.
A half cup of vinegar.
Once the jar had cooled off, drain all the water out of it.
Finally, fill the jar with the boiling liquid to the top and this
time close it tightly.
Turn it over, cover it with a piece of cloth and wait until it cools off. 
After that you can put it in a normal standing position, but
keep it in a cool place for future consumption.
And here we have a finished product. Look at these colours.
It actually looks incredible, doesn’t it?
Thank you so much for watching, guys. It really means a lot to us. 
So, again, thank you and until next time good-bye!
Say “good-bye”.
Good-bye!

To celebrate 50 k views, we’re making a Chicago Deep Dish 
Pizza which I wanted to try for a long time!
As you can see we’ll be using a lot of ingredients, but some of them are
optional and you are more than welcome to try your own ingredients.
To make the dough. Put 1 teaspoon [3.5 g, 0.1 oz] of dried yeast to 
3/5 cup [160 ml, 5.4] of warm water and mix it up.
Add a teaspoon of salt to a quarter kilo or 0.55 pounds of flour.
Then add the yeast.
And the last ingredient is a tablespoon of olive oil.
Fold it, stretch it, mix it until the dough is done.
Sprinkle it with flour, cover it with a damped piece of cloth and put it a
warm place to proof.
For the sauce we’ll be adding a can of tomato puree and 2 
tablespoons of tomato paste.
As for the spices we’ll be using 1 tablespoon of chopped garlic, 1 teaspoon
of dried basil, 1 tablespoon of dried oregano
as well as ¼ teaspoon of salt and pepper and finally a tablespoon of sugar.
Mix it up and put it low heat to reduce it.
Put some pork into the pan with some olive oil and fry it. We’re using 200 g [7 oz].
Sprinkle it with salt and pepper.
Then add some chorizo sausages to the mix and fry it until the meat is done.
This is some sauce bubbling in slow motion.
The dough is ready.
It looks beautiful.
The dough is ready once it’s doubled in size. Cover the table in flour. Then
using your hands and a rolling pin if necessary form a thin circle.
Spread some olive oil on the baking tray and then add some semolina,
so the pizza wouldn’t stick to the surface of the baking tray.
ut the dough over the baking tray, so it covers over it with some excess
dough on the edges.
Add about half of your mozzarella to the bottom. Here we have about
300 g [10.6 oz] of typical harder mozzarella and about 60 g [2.1 oz] of fresh mozzarella.
Add the meat in. Then some delicious Spanish ham.
And at last a few slices of chorizo sausages.
Cover the meat with another thick layer of cheese.
Add the sauce and spread it evenly on the surface.
Fold the overhanging dough inside to form a nice edge.
Put the pizza into the preheated oven at 220 °C [430 °F] for about 40 minutes or so.
This step is optional. We’re adding some olive oil on top to make it juicier.
We could have done that before putting it into the oven.
Grate some parmesan cheese on top.
We’re also using some Lithuanian cheese.
Garnish it with some basil leaves. It might be an odd thing to add basil
once the pizza is cooked, 
but it really makes more pleasing view to the eye, that’s why we prefer
adding it at the end.
We though it might be difficult to take the pizza out, but with this cake
tray it was just a piece of cake.
Anyway. Look at this beauty! It turned out great! Excellent I would say.
So juicy!
So, how is it, MO?
It’s tasty, little Romas.
It’s a special taste.
Thanks for watching, until next time. Good-bye, guys!
Hello, everyone! Thank you for 50 thousand views!
And I hope you’ll keep watching us. So, again, thank you. So… I’m trying
this one.
Great, pretty awesome!
You may press the red button.
Welcome. everyone, to MO’s kitchen...
But this time not in Lithuania...
Hello, MO!
Hello!
What are we making on this episode?
Today we’re making Pork Chops with Pineapple
and Broccoli.
To make the marinate for the pork mix about 7.6 cm or 3 inches of 
grated ginger with 5 grated garlic and then add about a teaspoon 
of salt.
Add 5 tablespoons of soy sauce and 5 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar.
Mix the marinate with 5 kilos or 11 pounds of pork and leave it for 
at least one hour to marinate.
Add about 2 kilos or 4.4 lb of broccoli and cauliflower mix and boil it for a couple of minutes.
Drain the water out.
Put the chops to the oiled pan and fry them until all sides are equally fried.
Add a slice of canned pineapple on each chop.
Add a piece of butter to the middle of each pineapple.
Put the pork into the preheated oven at 220 °C or 430 °F and cook it until
the meat is done.
It usually takes about 40 minutes or so.
Add 1 chopped onion to the olive-oiled pan.
Pour some soy sauce and balsamic vinegar according to your own 
personal preference.
Add 10 tablespoons of sesame seeds.
Add some vegetables.
Season them with salt, add more spices, if needed.
Fry the vegetables until they are done.
It’s very important to keep the meat moist while it‘s cooking.
Here‘s a table waiting to sit 20 people.
Okay. What are you filming here, grandson?
I’m filming you...
Like in the Army...
Yeah...
Thank you!
You’re welcome!
Our quest was to travel to Denmark to feed hungry Lithuanian workers.
Even if they weren‘t hungry just for one day, I think we succeeded.
To me this dish was a success. Something between Shogayaki and
Sweet and Sour pork.
MO?
Is it tasty?
It's very tasty!
Mhm.
It had cooled off a bit. Eat it fastly.
What are you filming here?
I’m filming you stuffed.
Okay. Cheers to you, grandson...
Wehad decided to go back to Lithuania, so we’re
waiting for the plane now...
Okay, guys, so this video was the last one in Denmark, so, please, let
us know in comments down bellow
if you would like to see more vlog type videos.
So, thanks for watching and until next time. Good-bye!
Good morning! Heh...
Hello and welcome! Today we’re preparing some pickles for
the winter.
This recipe is similar to the one we’d done before.
Because it’s likely that you’ll be using different size containers 
I’ll be saying all amounts of ingredients for 1 litre or 33.8 fl. oz
of this cucumber preserving liquid, so you could prepare the exact amount you need.
We cut cucumbers like that, but it’s up to you if you want them in
different shapes.
Once they are cut, put as many cucumbers into the sterilized container
as you can.
Liquify some honey if yours is not runny.
To 1 litre or 33.8 fl oz. of boiling water add 1 small chopped clove
of garlic,
1 cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of special preserving
spice blend which consists of dill, mustard, garlic, carrots, coriander,
bay leaves, black pepper and allspice.
Pour in a cup of vinegar.
A tablespoon of honey.
Mix a teaspoon turmeric with some water and then pour it into the
liquid.
Fill the container to the top with boiling liquid and close it lightly
with a sterilized lid.
Cover everything with a piece of cloth and leave it to cool off.
Drain the liquid out then fill the jar with the boiling liquid and close
it tightly.
Turn the jars over, cover them with a piece of cloth and leave them
to cool off.
After that you can put them in a normal standing position but keep
them in a cool place for future consumption.
Personally, I really enjoy this recipe I hope you’ll too.
Thank you, guys, for watching. It would help a lot if you subscribe

Hello, my name is, MO!
Hello and welcome my name is Romas!
On this episode we`re preparing a very simple and easy to make
snack made out semolina.
We`ll begin by adding 2.5 cups of water which we`ll then boil.
Add a teaspoon of salt.
A teaspoon of caraway.
When it starts boiling, add 2 cups of semolina and mix it well.
Add 2 tablespoons of oil to the dough once it had cooled off
and mix it.
2 teaspoons of oregano. Don`t be afraid to get your hands
dirty unless you`re making food. 
Emmmm... Okay. I guess this idiom doesn`t work in this situation.
Anyway, roll the dough between your clean hands and cut
them in preferable size.
Deep fry the pieces for about 5-8 minutes or until they become
significantly yellower.
It`s up to you to choose or make the sauce. We`re making
a simple mayo-ketchup-garlic sauce.
4 cloves of garlic, 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon
of ketchup. Mix it.
What do you think?
That it’s very tasty!
Mhm.
Thanks for watching and until next time. Good-bye!
Good-bye!
Very tasty chips!
It goes well with some beer
We’re very happy how it turned out and you should be too if you try it.
By the way, guys, it would help a lot if you subscribe to our channel
if you haven’t already and consider pressing the bell to see

and or use one of the links in the description to support us. 
Again, thank you and good-bye! Cheers!
So, what do you think?
Good evening!
We’ll be pickling...
We’ll be doing cucumbers...
With some garlic...
Hello and welcome!
On this episode we’re filming yet another pickled cucumber recipe.
This time with ketchup.
We cut cucumbers in rather small pieces, because it helps the
flavor to soak in, but of course you can cut them as you want.
A big batch, but it’s only one of many this summer.
Anyway, so here we have 5 kilos or 11 lb. of cut cucumbers to
which we’ll add 2 tablespoons of salt and 250 ml or 8.5 fl. oz of sugar.
Then a quarter kilo or 0.55 lb. of chopped garlic.
200 ml or 6.8 fl. oz of vinegar.
175 ml or 5.9 fl. oz. of oil.
Mix everything.
The last ingredients in this recipe is half a kilo or 1.1 lb. of tomato
ketchup preferably with as little preservatives as possible.
Mix everything well and leave it for the spices to soak in.
Some of your subscribers told me to show you more. So, say
something.
Say something.
I don’t understand anything you are saying...
Say something...
What do I say? If you knew how tasty this is...
After a couple of hours or so, give it a good stir and put it on
medium-high heat to boil it.
It got pretty dark, so we had to turn on the lights.
Fill the containers with some cucumbers, then close them
tightly with a lid and turn them over.
Bear in mind, that both the container and the lid have to be sterilized. 
Everything from the pot to the jars now.
We had put them and we’ll cover them and 
we’ll keep them through the night until they cool off.
That’s it.
Orghhhhhhhhhhh... Mission accomplished!
After that you can put them in a normal standing position but keep
them in a cool place for future consumption.
A rather easy recipe for ones who want some pickled cucumbers
for the cold season.

It’s great to cool off, isn’t it?
Ohh... It’s really good.
Evening had come before we made it, MO...
But we started at 6 o’clock, Romas. Yes...
... Doesn’t matter... Tomorrow will be our free day. We won’t
need to make anything...
Hello!
Today we’re making Pineapple Kompot.
Hello and welcome! On this episode we’re filming Fake Preserved
Pineapple recipe.
I remember when grandmother used to make us believe it was real
pineapple. The texture and taste are similar, so it’s actually possible
to trick someone into believing it’s real pineapple.
Begin by peeling and taking out all unnecessary parts.
Then cut them in cubes.
Okay, Young Chef, here we have some cut zucchini.
We’ll add some sugar, so they would start marinating.
These zucchini... 
That’s enough. We’ll leave for other layers of zucchini.
We’ll add them like that layer by layer.
To a bucket of zucchini, we had added a kilo or 2.2 lb. of sugar.
A bucket of pineapple.
We’ll marinate it for about 6 hours.
A litre or 33.8 fl. oz. of pineapple juice. Preferably with the highest pineapple
concentration available.
1 to 1.5 tablespoon of citric acid.
Keep them boiling for about 10 minutes or until they soften.
We’re heating the jars to sterilize them. Keeping them above boiling
temperature for about 10 minutes should be enough to get rid of all
microorganisms.
Fill the containers with some zucchini, then close them tightly with a lid
and turn them over.
Bear in mind, that both the container and the lid have to be sterilized.
Hello!
The work is done.
It’s hot in here...
We had made real pineapples. Yellow, beautiful...
Let it be tasty to you!
Let it be tasty to you!
Here...
We’ll cover them and let they stay through the night.
After that you can put them in a normal standing position but keep them
in a cool place for future consumption.
Thank you, guys, for watching. You would help even more if you subscribe
to our channel if you haven’t already. 
We really want to reach 1000 subscribers. Also consider pressing the bell

Until next time! Good-bye! Cheers!
I want to play some music...
Don’t you want this music at all?
Ohhh...
Hello, my grandson...
So, you wanted some pork today... Beef... Cooked Lamb...
Okay, we’ll make it.
Hello and welcome!
MO played the bowl at the beginning of the video by hitting a bowl with
a spoon and called it music… Yeah, she did that…
Anyway, we’ll start by poking the meat with a knife. This helps marinate
to reach deep depths of the meat.
By the way here we have 1.2 kilos or 2.6 lb. of lamb leg.
Season it with salt and pepper.
Rub about 5 tablespoons of mustard to the meat. Don‘t forget the cuts
you had made.
Then add 10 cloves of chopped garlic.
Leave it to marinate for about 2 hours or more.
Put it in the baking tray and cover it some olive oil.
Then put the meat into the preheated oven at 200 °C or 390 °F for about 2 hours
to make it well-done. Cook it for a shorter period if you prefer it on the rare side.
MO‘s getting her beautiful piece. If you’re wondering where these potatoes
came from, we had only added them 15 minutes ago to reheat them.
It’s tasty! The meat is soft... Soft...
Thank you [for watchintg]. Good-bye!
Until next time!
Anyway, thanks for watching and until next time. Good-bye! Cheers!
He-he-he…
Hello!
Pumpkin season has started. We’ll be making a pumpkin cake.
Hello and welcome!
Begin by peeling the pumpkin and taking out all parts you’re not planning
to eat.
Cut half a kilo or 1.1 lb. of pumpkin in cubes and put them into the baking
tray.
Put them into the preheated oven at 200 °C or 390 °F for about 30 minutes
or until they soften.
Crack 4 eggs into the bowl.
Add 1.5 to 2 cups of sugar and mix everything well.
Crush the pumpkin and leave to cool off.
Sieve 3.5 cups of flour. This add some air to the flour.
A teaspoon of salt.
A teaspoon of cake spice mix which consists of nutmeg, clove, cardamom,
all spice, cinnamon and ginger.
It needs more cinnamon, so we’re adding 0.5 teaspoon of it.
3 teaspoons of baking powder.
Mix everything.
Half a cup of brown sugar.
A cup of oil.
Pour the pumpkin in.
Finally, mix two bowls together until you achieve uniform batter.
Rub the tray with butter then add flour, so the cake wouldn’t stick to the
surface of the baking tray.
Add pumpkin cake to the oven at 180 °C or 360 °F for about 1 h 20 minutes
or so.
You can check if the cake is ready by poking it with a toothpick. If the
toothpick is clean, it means, the cake is ready. 
If the toothpick is not clean, it means it needs more time in the oven.
So? Such a beauty, isn’t it?
Mmm-mh-mhm…
A real pumpkin cake.
It’s very tasty!
Definitely worth trying!

Today we’re making Healthy Cookies.
Hello and welcome!
Cut a quarter cup of hazelnuts in smaller pieces.
Pour some boiling water over a quarter cup of apricots and a quarter
cup of raisins. Leave them to soak in water for about 10 minutes.
Then mix 300 g or 0.66 lb. of oats with a half cup of sunflower seeds,
a quarter cup of sesame seeds and a quarter cup of desiccated coconut.
Add hazelnuts.
Add a half cup of almond or different nut oil.
Take the apricots out of the water and cut them in small pieces.
Add a quarter cup of sugar.
Crack one egg in.
Add 2 tablespoons of flour.

Hello!
We’re making Chicken Breast with Tomatoes, Bell Peppers and Cheese.
Hello and welcome!
Start by cutting a chicken breast about 2/3 down into the chicken.
Season it with salt and pepper.
Insert a slice of tomato between the chicken.
A slice of bell pepper.
A basil leaf.
A slice of mozzarella.
Grate some harder cheese such parmesan on top.
Sprinkle it with some olive oil.
This is there we had made a rather big mistake… 
At first, we set the temperature way to low… The chicken was not cooking, so we
changed the temperature to 220 °C or 430 °F and finally, finally something started
happening...
Anyway, the cooking time in this temperature should be around 30 to 40 minutes
or something like that.
♫ We’re two brothers, both not married...
You’re older, so you try it first, MO.
Yes, I’ll try it first, because I had done most of the work.
I’m all sweaty, little child.
Mmm-mhm...
It’s so tasty!
Okay, I'll try it now.
The meat is very juicy!
Mhm...
Tasty.
Yeah, I really like it.
Do you like it?
Do you like it?
Yes, I like it.
I have to eat it before you finish it first.
Say “Thanks for watching”.
Thanks for watching.
Thanks for watching.
Mhm.
And until next time!
Good-bye!
And until next time! Good-bye!
You know, Romas, you could add garlic or onion to this meat, right?

We’re going to fry some potatoes now!
Yes, we’re!
Welcome to Delfi video!
We’re making Potato Chips.
Okay, don’t tell me what to do anymore...
Let me do my job and I’m going to sleep!
Hello and welcome to this very special episode!
Slice the potatoes first. I mean wash them first, then slice them you
know the drill.
The peel gives extra crunchiness, but it’s totally up to you if you want
the potatoes peeled.
Put all slices on the wooden skewer.
Then into some cold water.
To make the paste for about 10-12 medium-sized potatoes, add
5 tablespoons of flour.
A tablespoon of potato starch.
A half teaspoon of salt.
A half teaspoon of pepper.
A teaspoon of smoked paprika.
A tablespoon of your favourite chili sauce.
Add water until you reach similar consistency.
Heat up the oil.
I see you peeping, MO...
I’d like to congratulate you on 500 subscribers and give you...
This gold bracelet.
Okay, thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!
Such an excellent thing!
Yes...
Pure gold.
Mm-hmm... For sure...
over them in the paste, then deep fry them for about 5-7 minutes or
until done.
Put them on the paper towel to get rid of some oil.
Sprinkle some dried dill and salt on the chips.
Can I speak now?!
Thank you!
Dearest viewers!
Write us how you had managed to do these potatoes.
Here you are. Try some.

Hello!
We're making 
Tikka Masala.
Hello and welcome!
Start by cutting about a kilo or 2.2 pounds of chicken thighs 
in smaller pieces.
This time instead of saying all amounts, I had put them on the screen.
What do, guys, think? Is it better when I say it?
Or should I just say the name of the ingredient and leave 
the exact amount in the recipe? 
What’s your favourite approach? Let us know in comment section.
Mix all spices together.
Add some oil to the chicken.
Then add the spices and mix everything thoroughly.
Add more oil if necessary.
Melt a couple pieces of butter in the pan.
Add the chicken and fry it on high heat for about 10-15 
minutes or until they become brown.
Don’t forget to turn the pieces over once a while. 
You can chop 4 cloves of garlic and one big onion while the 
chicken is frying.
Move the chicken to the bowl.
At this moment the smell is irresistible, and I had small bite.
You could eat it now if you like the meat on the salty side. If 
not, let’s move to the sauce.
Leave the pan as it is, add chopped onion and fry them until 
they soften.
Add the garlic.
A tablespoon of tomato paste.
About a cup of tomato puree.
Simmer it for about 5 minutes. 
A teaspoon of ground ginger and a quarter teaspoon of chili 
flakes.
A can of coconut milk.
Cut the meat in smaller pieces.
So, the meat is almost done, MO, isn't it?
It's completely, completely soft... Fried...
It'll be in the sauce, so it will be even better.
Yes!
We'll add the chicken to the sauce.
Add some fresh cilantro.
Let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes.
Add some spices if needed.
Add some boiled rice and enjoy this incredible recipe.
So, MO and I have made Tikka Masala 
and now we'll try it.
Here, you're, MO!
You're a real Tikka Masala... Tikka Masala...
Real Tikka this...
I won't lie. I'm expecting a lot from this dish.
Mm-hm... You know it's really tasty for sure.
I strongly believe it should be.
Ohhh!
Ohhh! A guest!
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
It's very tasty!
Simple and tasty!
MO and I would like to thank for all views...
Likes, comments and so on.
Yes and good-bye!
Until next time!
Good-bye!
It's really good!
Don't eat everything!
Okay, little children, let's eat now. That's...

Hello, today we’re making Macaroni and
Cheese!
Hello, guys. We hope you’re doing very
well!
Begin by boiling a litre or 33.8 fl. oz. 
of milk.
I’ll eat a pear while we’re waiting for
the milk to boil.
Where did get this pear? From your garden?
Yeah, from my place. It’s very tasty.
Would you like some to try, Romas?
Yes, I would like to try some.
Okay, wait a bit...
Let me peel it.
Here you are, Mister.
Thank you.
Isn’t it tasty?
What are you eating, MO?
A sweet.
I didn’t give you any.
You’re a bad granny then.
Mh-hm.
You eat more sweets than I do.
Add 400 g or 14.1 oz. of macaroni and boil until the
pasta is tender and all liquid milk has gone. Choose
the shape according to your liking or availability.
Add 200 g or 7.1 oz. of butter and mix
everything well.
Mix the spices with pasta.
Two cups of grated cheddar cheese.
Garnish with some fresh basil if possible. 
Grate some parmesan or similar cheese 
on top.
Hello, today we’re making a real American
classic – Apple Pie.
“You have learned, Grandma, right?”
Mh-hm.
Like the Lord's Prayer.
Hello, guys! This is Romas and welcome to
our channel!
We’re making the dough.
Begin by adding 200 g or 7 oz. of butter
to 350 g or 12.3 oz. of flour.
Add 1 teaspoon of salt and 2 tablespoons of sugar.
Mix everything thoroughly until all
ingredients are distributed equally.
Pour ¼ to ¾ cup of ice water to the mix.
Usually ½ cup of water gives the best
results.
Sprinkle the dough lightly with the flour.
Then cover it in the plastic wrap and
keep it in the fridge for about 2 hours.
“What!?” Can’t you see? I’m peeling the
apples for the pie.
Where did you get these apples from?
I brought them from my garden.
Did you buy them in the supermarket?
Don’t talk nonsense. I have the garden.
Grandmother has a lot of things in the
garden. You know it very well.
Slice 1.5 [1.2] kg or 2.6 lb. of apples.
Add the spices.
Add ½ cup of white sugar and ¼ cup of
brown sugar to the apples.
2 tablespoons of flour.
Mix everything.
Cut the dough in two pieces. The bottom
part should have slightly more dough.
Flatten the dough then cover the cake
tray carefully.
Ask for help if needed. You see the dough
doesn’t hold very well on our right-angled
cake tray,
so it would be easier to use a cake tray
similarly shaped as the soup plate.
Put all apples in.
Flatten the remaining dough.
Cut it in 10 similar width strips.
Form the lattice by making each strip go
over the other strip then under the other strip.
There are better ways of doing it, but for
our first time it wasn’t too bad.
Press down on the edges of the pie.
Generously brush the dough parts of the
pie top with some egg wash.
Put it in the preheated oven at 200 °C or
390 °F for about 40 – 60 minutes or until
the pie is done.
Look at this beauty!
Yes!... 
The apples are bubbling.
Give it a few hours to cool off.
Say it.
I came back before you finished the pie.
You haven’t cut it yet…
No… 
It’s good that you have waited for me.
Oh… I got tired after going back and
forth. Oh…
This is what likes the pies.
She came the first.
You are kind for waiting for me, little Romas.
Look at this nice piece! Here!
Okay, so we’ll try the pie now. How is it, MO?
It’s tasty! I didn’t believe.
Mmm.
Tasty!?
Mh-hm.
Thank you everyone for watching, subscribing…

This is how grandmother is going to “shoot” it
with.
With some ice-cream.
Agh-hm.
So?
It suits.
Of course, it does.
For sure.
Hello, MO!
Hello, my little grandchild!
What are we making on this episode?
Today we are making Moroccan Pancakes.
Yes, I have ground them with a coffee grinder to make
some semolina flour.
Hello and welcome! We needed some semolina flour 
which is rather difficult to come by here in Lithuania. 
So, we decided to make some.
If you can buy, that’s great!
Add 3 cups of semolina flour.
1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour.
Some salt, sugar and dried yeast.
2 cups of warm water.
Blend it, Mister Chef!
Okay.
Blend it for at least 2 minutes.
Then add 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder and blend it
for at least 2 minutes.
Leaving the batter for about 5-10 minutes to proof should
be enough.
Now something we all have been waiting for –
the magical moment of the bubbles forming.
What can I say? It’s really nice seeing these holes pop up
in the pancake.
Two minutes on medium-high heat and the pancake is done.
The bubbles stop popping as the indication of the
pancake being done.
We’re making a simple very simple sauce: 1 part butter 2
parts honey that’s by volume of course. You can of course 
use jam, maple syrup or whatever you like the pancakes with.
Okay, so these are the pancakes we made. Okay…
Look at this nice pancake.
Mh-hm.
Where are you?! Look. You can see it through.
The pancakes with some Lithuanian butter and
Lithuanian honey.
The pancakes are Moroccan.
Agh…
Mm-hm. It’s tasty!
Of course it’s tasty! You always say the same thing, MO.
Yes.
You need to add more sauce, little child. They are very dry.
Mh-hm.
Yes, little child.
Mh…
Soft.
To me honestly, the sauce is too sweet, so I prefer the
pancakes with some jam. But you know, it’s up to everyone.
Thank, guys, for watching! You would help even more if
you subscribe to our channel if you haven’t already 
or decide to use one of the links in the description below to support us.
Until next time! Good-bye! Cheers!
What can I help you with?
Whatever you can with.
Mh… Okay, wait, I’ll give you something.
Here you are.
What is…
The first supporter!
Thank you!
For sure!
Good. Where is it from?
Lithuanian girl. You can read the name there.
I can't see, I left my glasses by the computer.
Rasa.
Rasa?
Mhm.
Thank you, Rasa!
It feels great right, MO?
Yeah.
The first…
Lithuanian supporter.
Yes.
Thank you for the presents, little Rasa!
If others, like to support us, I’ll leave a link to do that. 
Thank you, Rasa! It’s very kind of you.
And good-bye!
Good-bye!
Good morning! Today we are making easily made cookies!
Hello and welcome! Before we begin, I just wanted to announce that
we’ll be using metric system for our ingredient amounts as saying
it both in metric and imperial makes it too long.
However, you’ll be able to find recipe in both systems in the link bellow.
Now that we’re done with the news, we can start making the dough
for the cookies. Cut 200 g of butter in smaller pieces.
Then add 225 g of all-purpose flour or wheat flour as we call it here
in Lithuania.
Mix it thoroughly with your hands. You probably know how it’s done,
but if you don’t, just keep your eyes on MO.
Then a dash of salt.
A cup of sour cream. That’s 250 ml in metric.
Add the rest of flour which is again 225 g.
Oh... So, the dough is ready. It's now a ball, a cylinder. We're putting
it into the plastic bag and into the fridge for about 4 hours, so it would
cool off.
We're hiding it.
We can’t do it in one batch, so we’ll be doing it in a few batches.
Just add some flour on the table then using a rolling pin form a thin circle.
We are using 1 part cinnamon and 3 parts sugar to sprinkle the dough
with, but as always you can try different amounts or different spices.
Cue the music, please!
It should look more or less like this. 
MO is making the cookies. Pum-pa-ra-pa-pam.
Pum-pa-ra-pa-pam. This is what it will be.
Cut the dough in any shape you want.
Then put the pieces in the baking tray.
We have made two different shapes. The other wheel is really bad.
Okay, let's cook them!
In the oven they go at 190°C for about 30 minutes.
We have joked a bit, MO, again, haven’t we? 
Hehehe… Nonsense, but you'll have to eat it first.
Okay.
Are the cookie doughs done? They are really nice cookie doughs,
Romas.
Oh... They are so beautiful.
Here you are!
Mm-hm-mm… I’m flying to Denmark. The plane is flying already. 
Look at it, Romas, going higher and higher. Can you see it?
I see it. 
Hehehe…
How’s a cookie? 
It’s very tasty, Romas!
Mh-mh-mh…
Now it’s my turn to try them.
Not only the are very simple, but surprisingly delicious.
Thank you for watching! And please try to make some on your own.
Thank you and good-bye! 
If you want, you can make your name or anything out of these cookies.
It’s really simple and easy.

Today we are making Milk Doughies Soup!
Xорошо!Heh-heh… 
Hello and welcome!
Don’t ask me how I came up with this name… There’s milk and there’s 
dough and it’s a soup. Therefore Milk Doughies Soup.
How would you call this soup?
Leave your name suggestions in comment section. Let’s begin, shall
we?
A cup of water. 
800 ml of milk.
Put the liquid over the low heat.
It has to start boiling. I have to make the dough now…
To make the dough, mix a cup of flour, a cup of water, 1 egg and a 
pinch of salt. 
You might need to add more or less to reach the same consistency as 
ours.
You see. It’s boiling now. Okay that’s it.
Can I put it in now?
Yes.
What kind of digimons are you making, MO?
You’ll see you haven’t tried these digimons in your entire life. 
Grate the dough over the boiling soup using a grater.
Add some salt.
You're getting digimons here for sure, Romas!
Let it be tasty! The soup is ready!
Let’s go, MO, you have to try the soup you have just made.
With this warm fur coat?
You can.
Come on, little Romas… 
I have to bring the bowl closer, so I wouldn’t drop any soup.
Mh. It’s tasty soup. I liked very much at my work.
How many servings did you make at work?
I didn’t make any soups, Romas, but they used to make a huge pot 
of it.
I have to eat all of it now. That’s enough of filming…
Hello, everyone! Now it’s my turn to try it.
Hm…
What can I say, MO?! It’s tasty soup.
You see how good this is. 
Mh.
It’s the first time you are eating this soup.
Yes.
Homemade macaroni, isn’t it? 
You won’t be buying any macaroni, will you?
I am saying, it’s homemade macaroni.
Yes, they are. We could make homemade macaroni, if you ever 
wanted.
Okay.

It’s good. We can make it again…
You’re crying, because it’s been so many years, aren’t you?
Stop making me laugh… He-he… I swallowed.
Good afternoon, today we’re making Festive [Wedding] Carp with Vegetables.
That’s it. That’s enough. We’re ending the filming…
Hello and welcome to 1000 subscribers special episode on which we ‘re 
preparing a carp!
My voice is… It’s difficult to talk. I’m all excited about 1000 subscribers!
Anyway, add some oil to the pan.
Fry a half kilo of grated carrots for a couple of minutes.
Then add a half kilo of chopped onions and fry them until they soften.
Romas, you’ll be responsible for frying the vegetables while I clean the
carp.
Okay.
Are you trying to take the ribs out?
Yes, yes.
Did they teach you how to clean fish in Steak school, MO?
No, I had to learn it on my own, Romas…
It was difficult for me, but I managed to take the bones out of this… Fish.
I’ll leave this…
Here. That’s it. Do you see it?
Mhm.
This is what we have here. We have to add salt and pepper here.
A half teaspoon of both salt and pepper should be enough, but you can
add more or less, if needed.
A half kilo of chopped bell peppers.
By the way, I think it goes without saying, but you can try different 
vegetables to create your own unique recipe.
Add a half teaspoon of dried herbs to the fish.
2 tablespoons of chopped garlic.
Some spices.
Give it a good stir and then leave it to cool off.
Crack one egg in, mix everything well.
Stuff the fish with the vegetable mix.
Did you use to make such dish for the weddings?
Yes, such tricks…
He-he-he-heh… Only the ribs...
Move to the side!
How is it, MO?
It’s done very well.
All we have to do now is cook it!
Put it in the preheated oven at 200 °C for about 1 hour 10 minutes.
Look at this carp!
Yes, look how fat it is!
I have made so many of them.
How many?
Probably a hundred, maybe more.
Now we’ll try it.
Yes, we will, Romas.
Mmm-mh-mm…
You travelled 30 years back in time.
Yes, little Romas. It’s so tasty! Here… Try it, little Romas.
Okay… Now it’s my turn.
I have to say, I’m not a fan of fish, but I think this will…
Take some carp, little Romas.
I’ll say it in the video.
But I think I’ll like this one.
Here it goes.
It's tasty and warm.
Mh. I like vegetables. I like the fish itself. It simply great!
Mm?
What do I say? “Good-bye”? Heh...
Good-bye! Heh...
Okay, so thanks for watching and until next time! Good-bye!
You are eating the skeleton of the dinosaur, aren’t you?

Hello and welcome to the channel where grandmother says hello, 
her grandson narrates the recipe and we all have fun.
So, without further ado, let’s begin! 
Hi!
Today we are making Chicken Breast Cutlet with Mushroom Sauce.
Everything’s in place this time. Okay, that’s enough of filming this 
grey head…
Tenderize the chicken breast.
Add 3/4 teaspoon of pepper.
Have you ever noticed how strangely it sounds when you say 
“pepper and salt”?
Then a teaspoon of salt. Pepper and salt. Yeah… Very odd indeed.
Anyway, the final ingredient for the meat is a teaspoon of your 
favourite chicken spices.
We are using the one which says “chicken spices” on the packet. 
Nothing fancy, you know.
Add 60 g of butter to the pan.
1 finely chopped leek.
We’re adding the mushrooms now.
That’s my [says the names of the mushrooms], Romas which I had 
found and then froze them.
By the way that was 200 g of mushrooms. 
Add a teaspoon of mushroom powder.
1 tablespoon of tomato ketchup.
We’re adding some flour [1 tablespoon].
Add 2/3 cup of water or until you reach wanted consistency.
By the way now it’s a good time to subscribe while you are enjoying 
this nice slow-motion!
Some salt.
You increased the temperature, didn’t you?
No.
Some dill. The taste will be different. Okay, that’s enough.
We’ll add a tablespoon of sour cream.
A couple of eggs, some salt, pepper. Give it a good stir.
Some oil.
Take a piece of chicken, put it in the flour, then into the egg wash 
and finally into the pan.
Look, Romas, it’s not hot enough. Increase the heat.
After 4-5 minutes or so on 1 side, turn them over and fry them for 
another 4-5 minutes or so.
What are you doing over there? 
Me?
Mh.
I washed the plate, “what are you doing?”.
“What are you doing?”. What are you doing? Are you filming?
Yes.
What will you do after you film it? Will you be eating? 
What will you do after you film it? Will you be eating?
Yes!
It’s very nice. 
We are eating this cutlet with some boiled potatoes, so we’re 
adding some dried dill top of them.
Put some sauce on top of the cutlet and enjoy!
MO’s probably had a bite of the food, because she looks so happy!
I've had this cutlet many times before, so I know exactly what I’m 
going to get. It’s terrific and would recommend it to everyone!
MO!
You’re welcome. What do you want?
It’s your turn to try it!
Jesus, Jesus! To see what you have made, right?
No, to see what you have made.
Sit down over there. To your spot.
“Sit down over there”.
Yes.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Here you are.
I shouldn’t eat all of it.
Mh-mh-mhm. It’s so tasty for sure!
You used to make these during the wedding, didn’t you?
Yes!
I haven’t forgotten [how to make them]. 
Mh. So, thank you, MO, for making it!
You are welcome that you wanted this new dish.
It’s not that new. I have had it many times before. But it’s new for 
the viewers.
Yes!
Mh-mhm. It’s very tasty, Romas!

What’s up, guy?
Let’s begin with some b-roll, so you would get the hang of the dish we are 
making.
Hello! We are making Pork Sirloin with Thyme and Lemon Sauce.
Okay, three times of filming me is enough!
Mix spices together with flour.
Add some butter.
What we going to do now?
We are going to melt the butter and then we will fry the cutlets…
I mean chops.
Take a chop, put it in the flour, then into the preheated skillet for about 6-7 
minutes per side or until the chop is nicely browned.
We’ll clean the frying pan and then we will make the sauce.
Add some garlic and fry it for a few minutes.
Garlic is your favourite… Your favourite spice, isn’t it, MO?
Yes, garlics and onions.
Is that it?
Aha.
Do I put it in?
Yeah.
Add 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest and 1 teaspoon of thyme.
½ cup of dry white wine.
1/10 cup of lemon juice or according to your taste.
Some salt.
Pepper.
I think it goes without saying that you can use the amounts according
to your own personal preference.
Look at this painting, MO!
Yes, he-he-he… A pancake with horns.
Pancakes in the sauce.
Mmm-hm.
Mm-hh-hmmm.
It will be so tasty, won’t it?
Yes!
Add some sauce on top.
Don’t you want to get all of it on one.
That’s enough for you!
Hello everyome [everyone]!
Ahh… Mo allowed me to be the first one who tries it, so...
Here it goes!
I had some expectations for this dish and I was totally, completely, 100 percent…
Not disappointed!
I guess the key thing in making this dish is to get the right balance of 
lemon.
The lemon zest gives it a unique taste, but you know, don’t go 
crazy with it and should be good!
Will you try it, MO?
No, no, no, I won’t, little Romas, because I don’t look good right now.
I won’t go to the screen today!
OK…
Anyway, thank you for making it!
You are welcome!
It was very tasty.
OK, eat it now…
What are you making here?

Today we are making…
Where is “Hello”?
“Where is “hello”?”?
He-he… Stop making me laugh… Let me...
He-he-he-he-he...
You got it, didn’t you?
Yes, of course!
Heh-he-he-he-he-he…
Romas, delete these nonsenses…
No, Romas, I won’t say that…
For the last time.
Romas, we can do it the next time we make it as I can’t stop laughing now…
No, say it for the last time. “Hello, my name is MO”.
Heh-heh… Heh… Delete it. 
Okay, I’m deleting it. Say it!
He-he…
What are you deleting? 
Heh… 
My eyes are all wet. It looks like I cried.
Say it… It’s out of joy!
Say it, MO, don’t ruin the film.
Heh… He-he-he-he…
Good-afternoon!
My name is MO. Today we are making Chocolate Chip Cookies…
Heheheheh…
Hello and welcome! MO struggled to introduce the episode, but she managed to do more or less in the end.
Begin by mixing 2/3 cup of brown sugar, ½ cup of white sugar and a teaspoon of salt.
Pour ½ cup of melted butter and mix everything.
One egg.
A teaspoon of vanilla extract. Use a small bottle instead of these capsules…
Add a teaspoon of baking soda to 1 ¼ cup flour.
And then mix everything thoroughly. 
What’s now, MO?
I’ll add the tastiest thing now…
We'll add it to the fridge for half hour.
That’s it…
Into the bag… 
Here’s a robot for you, MO, to try it…
So…
Put it in…
[Inaudible.]
So… You can say something… 
MO got tired of making [food], that’s why Romas is making now. He-he-heh...
Yes.
Yes.
I’m trying… 
[His] arms are stronger…
Little robot…
He-he-he-he-he…
Look at it. 
Not much of it is left. But some… 
How much do we have left for? For 2? We have to put it in.
Put them in somehow and that’s it.
We’ll see if it doesn’t stick, MO. We’ll see.
Whatever happens, happens...
We suggest you leave bigger gaps between the cookies and you will soon find out soon why.
The oven is preheated to 180 °C. The cooking time should be somewhere between 12 to 25 minutes.
You can take them out as soon the edges start to brown, 
but you can keep them longer, just don’t forget to take them out before they start burning and you should be good.
You know what, Romas, that’s a pie and not the cookies.
Our cookies are stuck together, but it doesn’t matter. Heh… 
Yeah… The baking tray is too small, little Romas. This baking tray, you know… We need a larger baking tray… 
Aha...
A larger oven…
Let’s take then out, MO.
Pu-pu-pum…
Don’t worry, Romas. Everything will be fine. 
This, this, this… 
Yes!
And that’s it… 
We’ll wait, Romas, for such cookies to cool off. Such stickers… Nothing… It will be fine!
What do I say? I will eat some now. I have been working all day, Romas... 
Heh… Okay, okay. Here you are…
Heheh… 
Mh… I don’t know how to brake it…
Just brake it!
You can have some milk.
You let me?
Yes…
Okay, Romas…
It’s tasty!
[It’s] very tasty!
Mh. Okay… 
They look incredible, but the craziest thing about them is that they taste much better they cool off completely
as eating them warm is the same as eating pure sugar. 
So, take our time and let them cool off to enjoy them to their fullest.

For advertisement!
Heh. Yes!
Let’s begin, it’s getting hot for me!
Whole day, Matas…
OK.
I’m stepping…
What’s good out of it?
I have cut a good part of what she said later.

Some spices for the marinade…
More spices for the marinade.
Add 2 tablespoons of mustard.
2 large tablespoons of honey.
Pour juice from 2 lemons.
Then 1/2 cup of olive oil.
Blend everything thoroughly.
[Mix] the meat, potatoes with the marinade.
Mix marinade with 1 kg of pork bacon and about 6 medium-sized potatoes.
We’ll put the potatoes here.
We’ll marinate it for about 8-12 hours.
We’ll put it to a cold place.
What are going to do now?
We’ll put it nicely in the baking tray and then cook it.
So, the meat goes to the sides and potatoes to the middle.
Let’s do it like this. Aarr...
Mh…
Potatoes in the middle. The meat…
Yes.
At the sides.
Pour what’s left of the marinade on top.
Cover the baking tray with some aluminum foil.
Then put it in the preheated oven at 180 °C for about 1 hour.
The heat is really hitting us!
Yeah, the heat is really hitting us and the chops smell…
Prrrrrrrrr…
We have to take it off, my child Romas.
Yes!
Let it cook.
It has to brown.
It wouldn’t brown while covered.
The smell is nice!
Mh.
… around half hour.
We’ll have to drain some the liquid out, little child.
We would, if that was needed.
There was too much liquid, so we drained some of it out.
It has to be ready.
OK, take it out then.
Here, look at it.
Prrrrrr... Oh... Oh...
Why did you open it so fast?
Are you filming it or not?
Here. Do you see how nicely it has browned?
Mh.
Mh. How nice!
Look how nicely it looks!
Add some thyme on top.
OK, here it goes!
We'll see how good this pork chop is.
The meat looks nice...
I think it will taste great as well.
[Eating sounds].
Heh-he-he...
It's awesome. What can I say?
Cut me off a small piece.
It's really lemony flavour.
So, it's a bit sour, but I like it.
And I think you'll like it too.
Now what do you think about it, MO?
Leave me a small piece. 
I'll try and we will see, Romas.
I want this sauce. Heh...
Mh. It's tasty!
It's tasty for sure!
But you have to add some of that sauce on top, don't you, Romas?
You can, yes.
Yeah.
So, thanks for watching and until next time! Goodbye!
Goodbye!
You know, it's tasty!
Yes, little child, but you have to add some of this liquid.
As always, we would like to thank you for watching!

Hi!
Today we're making Cooked Pork in Greek.
It's not "in Greek", but "Greek".
OK, it can be Greek Pork if you want...
Hello, MO!
Hello! 
Ahhh… What do we have here? 
All of these are for the dough. 
These are for the sauce. 
And here we have some goodies too put on top of pizza. 
OK, let’s begin! 
Let’s make it. That’s e enough of… 
We're putting dried yeast in, as well as salt and sugar. 
The water has to be warm, doesn’t it, MO? 
It doesn’t have to be hot, but not as cold as ice…
So, the yeast and sugar would melt.
Give it a good stir.
Put the flour in. 
Maybe I should leave some flour for later. 
Add the water in.
Some olive oil. 
We’ll mix it. Then knead it with our hands.
It will be mistress Birutė, won’t it? 
Mh. 
Do you know this poem? 
I don’t, but you know what, MO? 
Yeah? 
I didn’t ask you what we were going to make? 
What kind of pizza are we making? 
Detroit pizza.
Yes, Det… 
American Detroit pizza. 
Yes, that is correct, Detroit pizza.
I haven’t forgotten yet, have I? 
No. 
OK, I think it’s to time to put my hands in and knead it. 
Mh. 
How’s the dough?
It will be fine!
It's good, isn't it?
Mh.
What are we doing now, MO? 
We are adding some oil to the bottle… Bottle… Heh...
To the baking tray to spread it. He-he-he… 
You have to be generous on it, don’t you? 
Yes, yes. 
So, the base wouldn’t stick. 
Will it be that large? 
You’ll have to make it that larger, MO.
Will I have to blow it out? 
Mh. 
You see, maybe it will be large enough. 
We’ll put it a warm place to proof. 
About 1 hour, 2.
Probably 1 hour, we’ll see maybe more than 1 hour for it to proof. 
OK.
Let’s bring it to the bathroom.
You are stupid. 
Heh… MO said to stop it…
So what? We have to show how we do it. 
“Pokémon”!
You know, Romas. 
Please, put it in. 
Mh. 
Add 3 tablespoons of tomato paste then mix everything.
Add 3 tablespoons of tomato paste then mix everything.
You see, I forgot to blend everything together, so I am doing it now.
To all ingredients I have added some tomato puree and now I am blending them. 
So, don’t forget to blend everything before putting the mixture over the heat. 
Of course, we could have blended everything before, but I forgot, so it will be just fine like this. 
Everything is fine here.
So, at the moment we’re reducing the sauce.    
It will take some time....
Maybe half an hour, not so sure… 
But we will see… 
Oh…
Hello, guys! 
I just wanted to make a quick announcement. 
You know, we are still struggling to find the best way to make 
these videos. 
So, allow us some time to figure it out and eventually we will. 
So, I guess, thanks for patience, that’s all I wanted to say this time. 
So, keep watching us and you’ll see how we manage to do that.
Cut the cheese in cubes or any other shape you want.
We are using something like Parmesan, 
some orange cheddar and some nameless 
regular cheese.
You know what?
We should push the dough to the sides, if that’s possible.
You can…
His dough wasn’t too even too. 
Whatever you can. 
We’ll see...
Look how great this looks. 
Here. Look how awesome it is!
Yes.
The pizza will be great!
We’ll go to visit others with this pizza.
Aha.
Help me put everything in. 
I will help you...
Put the pizza into the preheated oven at 220 °C for about 15-20 minutes 
or until the cheese on top starts to brown lightly.
To get the best results when cooking the pizza in a regular oven, put it in 
the lowest position and use the program with heat coming from the 
bottom and air circulation.
It was the first we used this method and the result were incredible.
Would you look at this!
It’s so beautiful in the forest…
Close the oven.
Don’t you think to cut it…
Is it stuck?
Mh.
It’s not too bad.
You see, little Romas, it’s very hot.
Actually you can wait.
But we have to hurry.
I’m not sure if that was the ingredients we used or the oven program, but 
the base was different, but in a good.
Like a flat bun, but with cheese sauce and everything!
I don’t think I can recommend it enough to you.
It’s really that good!
Wow!
I’m still remembering this incredible pizza as I’m narrating the script, 
which means that I’m remembering this pizza as I’m writing the script.
Yeah…
I can’t stop thinking about this pizza…
Anyway, guys, we would like to thank you for watching!
It really means a lot to us!

Hello, MO!
Hello!
OK, guys, I just wanted to make a quick announcement...
Good afternon, today we're making Grated Potato Zeppelins.
What do we have to do at first?
At first, you have to grow potatoes.
Come on. Heh.
Say hello to your viewers, MO, who came to potato
harvesting!
It's potato planting and not harvesting!
Yeah, potato planting.
MO has potato field which we can't see the end of.
Oh, come on...
It's humongous!
8 potato rows.
It's 12, you have just counted them up!
Yeah, but will here be?
There will be some onions here, little Romas. Let me through,
little Matas.
Let me show you.
MO is planting the potatoes, aren't you?
MO is planting them, but Romas and Matas, and everyone will eat them.
But we're planting them, MO. But you know, MO, it's a job
for robots...
Okay, okay, you are robot...
I'm for real.
We're like robots as well.
I'm not a robot, MO.
It's a nice feeling to touch the soil...
Maube for 5 minutes, but not for long, for a few hours.
What do you mean " for long". It has only been 1 hour.
The sun is coming down now.
To west!
We might not do it in time!
Come on... Heh=he-he-he-he-he-he-he...
We only have 3 rows left and he says he has no time!
You are a joker!
We have to plant the onions.
We won't be planting them, little Romas.
I'l plant them on Wednesday when I come here.
MO's planting.
By hands.
You see, Romas, it's the best way!
I'll cover it with some soil and it will be burried...
Why are you cursing so badly in front of your viewers?
Thank you, little children, thank you, thank you for helping me!
Why don't you show them what we have done. Tell us.
Look at it. We have planted the potatoes. Let's go home,
the sun is going down.
How many kilos have we planted?
Buckets. How many? Bags?
9 buckets.
Ah, maybe even more.
Maybe.
How many rows have we planted?
9 rows, little Romas. Here we have 3 empty rows, which we
will use to plant onions, carrots and beets.
Is it clear?
It is, yeah...
Show your potatoes.
They are huge!
Yes.
You told me they would be small.
You see what they are now.
Aha.
But you see, Romas, just a few.
Not many?
Not many, 4 potatoes, some times 6 - there are some smaller
ones, usually there aren't many...
Not many at all.
You shouldn't have been complaining that much then as there are some.
Yeah, look at these beauties. Okay!
You are finishing, aren't you?
Yes!
Why aren't you asking for your subscribers to help?
You know how fast 500 would harvest these potatoes?
Yeah, 10 minutes.
Heh, yeah.
Look at my huge "beets" I have in the cart!
Aha.
Look at these beauties.
Look here!
Wow!
You must be adding some good chemicals to them!
No chemicals at all, little Romas.
You see, maybe the soil them for good for them this summer.
You told me there wouldn't be any.
Yeah, I told there would be no potatoes.
I have to take some pictures to put on the video.
Here!
I have to put the largest potato on top!
Aha, put the largest ones on top!
He-he-he-he-he-he-heh...
We're going home. Heh...
Aha, nobody is helping you, MO!
If you were a good grandchild, you would help!
Okay take it, I'll let you film!
I see you walking!
So, I'm helping, MO!
Because nobody else is helping!
Good boy!
What kind of chemicals have you put in, so that they so large?
Some grass...
Rotten.
Yes, Romas, did you see how much grass there was...
Not really.
You don't remember.
Everything was spread accros the soil in the autumn.
Look at these, MO. You were complaining that there would be
no potatoes.
There are a lot of them.
The whole basement is full.
Yes, yes.
The potatoes are really beautiful, little children.
I'll peel the potatoes now.
Do you know how to peel the potatoes? Eh? Have you helped me at least once?
I have helped you.
I'll see how you would help me.
You'll have to help me if you want to eat some zeppelins today.
Who will be filming?
Mh?
You don't to film people peeling the potaoes. It will be faster, if you help me.
We're putting them into some cold water.
We will be grating the potaoes now.
We will squeeze... The grated potatoes.
Look at this specialy disigned bag.
Yes, it's nice!
Oh!
You can put more.
Ahh, it's difficult, Romas.
You don't have to squeeze all the way out, don't you?
No, no.
Here.
We're moving it over there.
Yes.
Here. We'll move the liquid to a different container, so that
the starch would start to set.
We' prepare the stuffing for the zeppelins.
What are you doing here?
Cut the onions finely.
A couple of onions.
Yes. One is larger, one is smaller. That will be enough
We're adding them to the meat.
We're adding some dried basil leaves.
Mhm.
What else?
And peppers. Almost a full teaspoon.
Maybe I should get a teaspoon for the salt.
And salt... That will be too much...
Not much of it.
Here.
That's it.
Mangle everything well.
The water is set to start boiling for the zeppelins.
Here. We will make the potato batter now.
Drain the liquid...
Out...
Here.
We will put the starch into the grated potaoes.
Quality stuff.
You see quality everywhere.
Yeah, yeah.
Mix everything now, right?
Yeah, we will mix everything and...
Here.
As always you will be able to find the recipe in the link in the 
description below.
Yes, we're adding the starch.
You'll put everything in, won't you?
Yes, I will probably put everything in, Romas.
I can't rub it off.
Some salt.
One and a half?
That will be enough for sure. We will be adding some salt to
the water as well.
It won't be too salty.
Let's mangle it.
So, MO?
Take a piece of grated potato mixture.
Make sort of... a pancake
We'll add some meat. Heh.
Fold the edges.
Close it and there will be a zeppelin.
So, you decided to make a few with the curd.
Yeah, I'll make a few for with the curd, but you don't like them,
but I like them a lot.
Here.
The making of them is the same, isn't it?
Yeah, it's the same. I won't be adding anything, no salt, no egg,
to this curd.
But you can.
Yes, you can, but I don't need it here.
You can add some fried bacon pieces.
"Fried bacon pieces."
You can add some smoked bacon to the curd.
Yeah, yeah.
But I don't need any bacon, no nothing.
We'll make rounded balls.
Here.
Those will be my zeppelins.
You'll eat 3 of them, won't you?
2!
3.
I'll leave the third one for you.
I think you will eat all 3 of them.
Maybe I will eat all 3.
Of course.
I won't eat any with the meat and...
I am goin to the shop to more curd, so you could make of
them.
Stop dreaming, okay?
I'l have enough, Romas.
Here.
We'll add large teaspoon of salt... Maybe...
I'll add a little bit more...
Here.
"What are you doing?" I'm adding them to the pot to boil.
We'll add them.
How long will they boil?
At least 15 minutes.
Will 9 be enough for you?
Maybe that will be enough for today.
Here.
Boil nicely and don't break.
The sauce is being prepared for the zeppelins.
So, what' now?
We'll wait for them to fry.
We'll cut the... The bacon is cut.
We will cut the onions later and put them in. You can stop
filiming, little Romas.
But you can film, if you want.
How long will you fry them for?
For about 3 minutes, everything will be done, the sauce will
be done.
The zeppelins are really nice.
Yeah.
You have decreased the temperature, haven't you?
No, I haven't.
It's boiling slowly, maybe it will be okay.
Oh, they are soft.
Your zeppelins are soft.
That's it.
How many do you want right now? 5 of them?
2.
I though I should put 5 in for you.
So, I'm going to try them now of course.
It will the happy part now, won't it?
You can call it like that.
It's so hot for me!
This is how it looks.
If you have not tried Lithuanian zeppelins, be sure to try them.
The zeppelins can be eaten without any fried bacon pieces,
but most Lithuanians like them fat,
but maybe you're not Lithuanian.
Well, the most important thing is to eat in a way, so you would enjoy them!
This recipe is really simple.
There aren't any fancy ingredients, but the zeppelins are
pretty much incredible!
MO is scratching her pots at the moment, she will soon
show her...
Heh...
Zeppelins with the curd.
Here, look at my zeppelin over here.
I'll film you right now, MO.
Don't you want to try some of my zeppelin?
I'll try it later.
I'll give you 1, so you could not only try it. but also have it.
There's a lot of...
Show me how it looks!
You can add a mint leave to the curd, but you know...
But I forgot.
It's a tasty zeppelin for sure, Romas.
It turned out great.
Yeah, they turned out grate. The grated potatoes really
turened out great.
It's really soft.
Thank you for watching!
Try them for yourself, they turn out great for you too!

Flatten out a pancake!
He-he...
I was a bit too slow to capture it...
What is needed to be done here, MO? 
“What?” You wanted me to make some Meat Jelly, so we are making it!
Yes, Romas. We'll soak the legs. It’s very fat, it will take a long time to 
make it.
It’s good that it takes a long-time boil.
Here we have the legs.
A shank. A piece of it...
An ear. 
We'll soak [them in the water] to lose all blood.
And two pieces of turkey...
Here...
We'll keep for half hour and it should be good. 
Don’t talk nonsense... 
For about 8 hours. 
Jesus, Jesus!
Give it some power, MO!
It’s cold.
What are you filming now? 
Romas... Don’t make mad. Take this pot and take it out of here... 
Who will be filming, MO? You? 
Where’s no need for that... Stop it, Romas... Okay?
Hello, MO!
Hello, hello! 
What are we going to do now?
The meat jelly [meat] is watered, cleaned, ready, soaked... We’ll put it 
into the pot and we’ll boil it.
An ear to the bottom.
The legs go here. 
This we’ll be Halloween Special, MO. 
Halloween... You are like Halloween... 
Here. That’s it!
Turn on the brick [heat]. 
Mh. 
You have to add a lot of water, so it covers it well over as the water 
evaporates and gets into the air, when it boils. 
What are going to do now, MO? 
We’ll cover it and wait for it start boiling. 
If there are some foam... 
We’ll clean them again, if the meats foams too much. 
That’s it... 
Say something, MO... 
We’ll have to take the foam out, little Romas, we'll see.
Look at it, it’s not too bad... 
Increase the heat, so it boils.
Let it boil for about 10 minutes and then…
What’s now? 
We’ll take the meat out and get rid of the broth. 
What are you doing now? 
Nothing. I’m cleaning it and that’s it. 
And then again into the pot. 
Increase the heat, so it would start boiling. 
We’ll boil it for at least 3 hours once it starts boiling. Yes...
Tell me, what you put in here. 
What?! Carrots, onions, pepper, bay leaves, salt. 
All spices. 
You see how slowly it’s boiling. You have to boil it slowly, little Romas.
Maybe I’ll cover it a bit, so it would boil faster, but it will be boiling for a 
long time. 
Mh.
The meat is fall off the bones. 
You know, Romas, it is done. We have to turn it off now.
We’ll eat, then we’ll take the meat off the bones. 
Okay. 
Turn it off. 
I’m covering it and leaving it... 
Let’s finish the Meat Jelly. That’s enough of you to... 
Look at this clear water which it has been boiling in. 
Mh. 
Put this lid over there. That’s enough. 
What do we have to do now, MO? 
Take it out of the water take the meat off the bones and cut the meat in 
small pieces. 
“What do we have to do?“
You’ll see what we have to do. 
I’m deboning the meat. I’m taking the bones out of the meat. 
Here, it will be the best... 
Here, Romas, a full bowl of meat. 
Mh. But there are a lot of bones as well. 
No... Look at it. There should be more meat than bones. 
Yes, there more meat, but still. 
Let’s put it over the heat, Romce. 
Okay. 
Turn it on. 
Here. It will boil. Jesus, the pot is so heavy. 
I have to add some water right now, because that will be too little of it...
It won’t look as meat jelly at all.
We’ll add a teaspoon of it and then we’ll add more, if needed. 
All of you have taste buds in your mouth... 
One likes it without the salt at all. 
While the other likes drinking salt water. 
Yes. 
Here. It has started boiling and has been boiling for some time. 
Pepper.
6 garlic cloves. 
And, and, and…
Here we have dried celery leaves and lovage leaves. 
That’s it... 
We’ll mix it and see if we need more salt. It will be good. 
We’ll pour it to the containers. 
…taste buds... He-he... 
You have to feel the salt. If you don’t, then it won’t be salty. 
Mh. Maybe I should add some more, because it will taste different 
when it cools off.
I’ll add some more. 
It’ll be okay for sure now.
You have to feel the salt. 
It’s different when it cools off. 
The work is done. 
Yes... 
We have to pour it into the containers you have and cool it off a cool place. 
Let’s pour it into some container. 
It has to have some liquid as well as meaty parts. 
Yes, yes... 
Okay, that’s it. 
Here. 
We’ll pour it into the containers like this and it will be prepared this 
Meat Jell. Here you are. 
We’ll wait for it to cool off. 
We’ll put it a cool place and it will cool off. Here. 
This is how you have to do it, MO, right? 
Yes. 
Whoosh. 
Oh!
Here!
Look at it! 
I have put it not straight, Romas. 
It doesn’t matter. It’s crazy! 
He-he-he-he... 
You have done it nicely! 
Yes! 
I was trying really hard. 
Here, Romas. This way!
Ta-dum! 
What will you be eating it with?
With some horseradish. Don’t you want some? 
It’s already in! 
I like it with some horseradish. 
Eat it, eat it! 
“Eat it”. Do you let me? 
Mh. 
Are the horseradish too potent? 
Yeah? 
Very potent, little Romas!
How’s the Meat Jelly? 
It’s tasty! Please, try it! 
Okay! 
Meat jelly was great and tasty. By the way, you can add more water if 
you want more jelly, but I like it as it is. 
One more thing. If you are wondering how MO managed to place the 
decorations so nicely. 
She had put a thin layer of jelly liquid, put the decorations in, cooled off 
the layer of jelly and then she poured little bit cooled off Meat Jelly.
That’s the secret. 
Is it all of it for me to eat it?
You’ll eat it. 
In a few days we will, yes.
During today! 
Thank you for making it! 
It was tasty! 
Good, eat it then. 
You can look here, into the camera. You can say something to the 
viewers. 
Try to make some Meat Jelly yourself. 
Okay, I’ll say it like this. 
We have listened to your recommendations and made the Meat Jelly.
You can write more recommendations, maybe we’ll do them someday!
Thank you for watching and until next time! Bye! 
Bye!
How to say that in English? 
Good-bye! 
Good-bye!

Hello, guys!
On this episode my grandmother shares her secret how to catch an enormous pike!
By the way, you can follow me on social media to see what we do every day, if you are into that.
Good afternoon! Today we are making Minced Pike.
Where did you get this pike from? 
Did you catch it yourself? 
Of course, I did. 
She went to the lake, caught a fish and came back. 
Heh... Yeah, and brought it back home. 
What did we put in? 
Onions to fry. 
Okay, you’ll have to look after them.
Look at this beautiful fish. 
Which I caught by myself. 
How’s it done? 
I’ll leave this tail fin...
It’s doesn’t seem to be going… 
But it does! 
Here! 
Do you see it? 
The last cut for this pike! Here! 
Look. Heh… 
Do you see what’s left of the pike?
Mh.
Yes, Romas, we will put the meat in. We’ll mince it and put it in. 
Mmm… 
We’ll put the spices in and that’s it.  
There will be a pike. What do you mean “you won’t use it”? 
I don’t know… 
Now it’s time to get all the meat. 
We’ll mince the meat twice now. 
Our onions are done now, so we'll leave them to cool off.
Put it in the balcony to cool off, MO.
Come on, Romas, Stop it, Romas!
Stop it with your nonsense.
It has to cool off and that's it. That's you should have said.
We have to show as well.
Romas, f***...
Don't curse, I'll have to bleep out again...
Romas, I know you won't be doing such nonsenses...
The onions are cooling off here in the balcony.
This is my garden, I have a lot of spices.
What do you have to say?
What is growing here?
Here we have some rosemary, basil, again rosemary, basil.
What do we have here?
Ahh... I think parsley.
And. Ahhh...
How is it?
Thyme.
We'll use a meat grinder to mince the onions.
So, that little children wouldn't take them our and eat 
everything.
They wouldn't feel them.
Add 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper.
Then add 1/3 teaspoon of allspice powder.
Nutmeg.
Mhm.
Some fish spices.
Here you are.
What else?
"What else?"
Salt.
A lot of it...
No, no...Some...
A teaspoon.
That will surely be enough, little Romas.
2 tablespoons of semolina.
Yes.
A couple of eggs.
I think that we'll be enough butter for it.
So, it won't be low-fat.
Grate one half of carrot or as much or little as you want.
You are after all the master of your own kitchen.
Just say it, but don't added it yet.
We'll add heavy cream.
We're adding parsley.
What else is here?
Parsley and dill.
Ah... Parsley and dill.
We'll mangle the fish now.
Where did you learn this recipe from, MO?
From my head, I made it.
I'm asking for real.
We used to do it before, Romas.
There was minced carp in pieces just like this.
We had to make it, Romas.
We had huge... We had huge pots to prepare and took us
forever.
The most important moment is right now, MO.
I have cut off too much, but there's nothing we can do.
Explain, MO, what we have to do here, MO.
Here. We will put the meat back into the skin.
We'll stuff the meat back inside.
It will be boneless fish, MO.
It will be boneless, so you will not need to take the bones out
today.
Let's roll it.
Here! We'll put it to the pot.
Here.
Oh...
We'll fix it when it's hot after taking it out.
Okay. Here.
It's your fish, MO, you caught it.
Okay, that's enough, let's go.
What did you use to catch it?
I used a fishing rod, what do you think?
Yeah, but did you use a fish or those dead gummies?
I don't know what I used and don't ask me more. Here. That's it.
Mmm...
We'll add a carrot.
Here. Okay.
Some bay leaves. What else?
Here. Allpice.
1, 2, ... 4, 5, 6. There will 6 of them.
And some black ones. 1... Okay it doesn't matter.
Here. Some black ones and some allspice.
Parsley, salt.
1 tablespoon, I mean 1 teaspoon.
Okay, that's it. Now some cold water and that will be it.
Here.
It has enough water to its eyes.
How long will we boil it for?
After it starts boiling 35 minutes or 40 minutes.
The last minutes for the fish to boil.
Call it a squid.
A squid. That will be your squid.
Yeah.
5 more minutes and it will be done.
It's good.
It's done, little Romas.
We'll take it to the balcony to cool off, won't we?
Heh, to the freezer to cool off...
You can't put it to the freezer, MO.
He-he-he-he-he-he-he-he...
So, what that you are filiming, little Romas. You won't be
adding it.
I will, the fish is swimming towards us. Here...
Come on...
You are putting everything on the ground...
Oh...
I see, little Romas, here.
We'll soak 1 tablespoon of gelatine
We'll pour it over to make our pike more beautiful.
We're pouring 250 ml of water.
And we'll soak it, that's it.
What will it be now?
Help us, God, to take it out easily. Heh- he- he.
Ohhh...Ehhhh... Here...
Look at it!
Do you see how beautiful it looks, Romas?
That's the soup!
Yes, you can, boil something to eat.
We are untying, are we?
We'll untie it and undress it.
Ahhh...
How good this is.
Curl to the side, tail.
Wait, I have to...
A monster pike.
Yup, a real monster. Look at this monster.
It's not bad at all.
Yeah, it's not bad at all.
Heh-he-he...
We'll leave it to cool off and then we'll pour some liquid over.
We'll dress it up.
Again. He-he-he-he....
The liquid is nice.
Everything will be used to pour over the fish. That's it, Romas.
We'll heat the gelatine, so it would soak.
We'll put it here for it to heat it up and...
Here. Do you see it?
It melted.
Yes, that's it.
We'll add one of this as well.
1 cup.
That will be enough of this liquid.
That will be enough over our eyes. That's it.
So?
It need just a little bit more salt.
It has started setting, so we're pouring it over.
There's nothing else to tell. Here.
You see, it will be ice pike. Covered in ice.
Mmm...
It's a shame to cut, isn't it?
Yes!
It would be better if we just put aside to look at.
Yes.
Look, MO, you can't even say that it was cut.
Here.
That's true.
Okay, okay, you can barely see it.
You must be thinking, that it is bad as I having such a small
bite, but really it really isn't.
It's just that picked up the fork with right hand and I wasn't
comfortable for me, so I wanted to be done with the tasting 
scene as soon as possible.
It's honestly good and you should try it!
The best thing about is that it doesn't have any bones.
Anyway, now it's MO's turn to try.
It's very tasty indeed!
All it needs now is some white salad.
Why don't you do it this white salad?
We will make it, but there wasn't enough time.
Thank you for watching and goodbye!
Goodbye!

You know, MO, if it too big of the deal to cut it, maybe we should
taste it?
Yeah, let's better wait for guests to arrive.
There aren't any guests coming...
